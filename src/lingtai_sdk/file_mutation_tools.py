"""Side-effecting file-mutation tool bundle declarations: ``write`` / ``edit``.

The **side-effect counterpart** of :mod:`lingtai_sdk.file_tools` (stage 3A). Where
``file_tools`` declares the three *read-only / query* file tools (``read`` /
``glob`` / ``grep``) — all uniformly ``SecurityDanger.SAFE`` — this module
declares the two low-state file tools that *mutate the filesystem*, ``write`` and
``edit``, as :class:`BundleManifest` objects and offers the same thin
declare-and-inject host seam through the non-native
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost`.

It lives in its own module (rather than extending ``file_tools``) precisely
because ``file_tools`` carries an invariant this module must break: *every*
``file_tools`` manifest is read-only / ``SAFE``. Write and edit are
side-effecting, and — unlike the read tools — they do **not** share a single
danger posture, so they cannot flow through ``file_tools``'s shared
all-``SAFE`` ``_file_tool_manifest`` helper. Keeping them apart preserves
``file_tools``'s "all SAFE" guarantee and gives the side-effect posture a clean,
explicit home.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in ``file_tools``, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``write`` / ``edit`` implementations. Those bind to wrapper-owned
services (``agent._file_io``, ``agent._working_dir``) at ``setup()`` time and
stay in the wrapper; importing them here would break SDK import-purity (the SDK
must not eagerly pull a wrapper service) and the dependency direction (the kernel
must never import the SDK). So this module ships *declarations + an injection
seam* only:

    declared manifest (write/edit)
       -> file_mutation_tool_hosts({name: handler})  # wrapper injects its real handler
       -> host.invoke(name, **args)                  # runs the wrapper's existing logic

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies those handlers lives in
``lingtai.core.file_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK; the SDK must not
import the wrapper). The tool **schemas and behavior are unchanged**: the bridge
reuses the existing ``lingtai.core.{write,edit}.make_handler`` /
``get_schema`` handlers verbatim; this module only embeds a copy of each schema
in the manifest metadata as a declaration.

The two manifests share most of their posture — non-privileged, freely
``REPLACEABLE``, ``in_process`` transport — and each declares exactly one public
tool named after the file tool (``write`` / ``edit``). They differ in their
declared **danger posture**, which is the heart of this module:

* ``write`` creates a file **or silently overwrites an existing one wholesale**
  — an irreversible clobber of prior content — so it declares
  ``SecurityDanger.DESTRUCTIVE`` (the same posture the privileged ``system``
  bundle uses for its irreversible-teardown actions). Under the stage-17
  :mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge`, a ``destructive`` tool is **denied** in the
  default ``BLOCKING`` policy mode and **allowed-with-warning** in ``ADVISORY``
  mode.
* ``edit`` performs a **bounded, in-place string replacement** in an *existing*
  file and refuses ambiguous edits (``old_string`` not found, or found more than
  once without ``replace_all``). It is a real side effect with lasting effects,
  but not a wholesale clobber, so it declares ``SecurityDanger.CAUTION`` (the
  same posture ``psyche`` / ``soul`` use for lasting-but-not-destructive
  actions). Under the guard bridge, a ``caution`` tool is **allowed-with-warning**
  in both policy modes.

This posture is a *declaration only*. This stage wires **nothing** into live tool
dispatch: ``setup()`` remains the live registration path and is unchanged, and no
guard is installed on any ``Agent``. The guard semantics above are what the
existing stage-17 :mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge` would derive from these
manifests *if* a later stage chose to install it — which this stage asserts as an
invariant (see ``tests/test_sdk_file_mutation_tools.py``) without changing any
runtime behavior.
