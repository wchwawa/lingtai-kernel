"""High-state ``soul`` inner-voice bundle declaration + native host seam.

The privileged, native-only mirror of :mod:`lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools` (the
``system`` lifecycle surface, stage 3C) and :mod:`lingtai_sdk.psyche_tools` (the
``psyche`` identity/context surface) for the **third** core surface — the agent's
reflective inner voice: periodic past-self consultation (``flow``), on-demand
self-inquiry (``inquiry``), flow/voice tuning (``config`` / ``voice``), and a
``dismiss`` alias that clears the soul notification surface.

Single source of manifest truth
--------------------------------
The ``soul`` :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` is **not**
redeclared here. It already exists in :mod:`lingtai_sdk.core_bundles`
(:func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.soul_bundle`, stage 8) — ``required`` +
``privileged`` + ``native_only`` + ``NATIVE_ONLY`` + ``native`` transport, one
public ``soul`` tool, bundle-level ``danger=caution``. This module *reuses* that
manifest verbatim (``soul_voice_manifest()`` is a thin re-export) so there is
exactly one ``soul`` manifest in the SDK, and adds two things on top:

1. a **per-action risk table** (:data:`SOUL_ACTION_RISK`) that grades each ``soul``
   action individually (``soul`` is a flat ``action`` discriminator like
   ``system``, not an ``(object, action)`` pair like ``psyche``);
2. a **``soul``-specific native host seam** (:func:`soul_voice_host`) — the
   privileged-native mirror of ``system_lifecycle_host``, wrapping
   :func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.native_core_host` so a host injecting *one*
   real ``soul`` handler does not have to also supply ``system`` / ``psyche``.

Why a per-action risk table
----------------------------
A single bundle-level ``caution`` posture cannot distinguish the actions that run
an LLM consultation and persist state from a lighter notification dismiss. The
conservative, faithful encoding is: keep the **bundle-level posture at ``caution``**
(what the stage-8 manifest and the stage-17 guard bridge already derive — the
strongest soul action *is* ``caution``), and ship the **graded action table as
metadata**. The grading mirrors the side effects the real built-in tool
performs in code (``intrinsics.soul.__init__.handle`` dispatch); it is a
*declaration of* that posture, never a second gate. Like every stage-3 risk
helper, the lookup fails safe **high** (an unknown action grades ``DESTRUCTIVE``).

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in stages 3A/3B/3C/8, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import,
or call the real ``soul`` implementation. The real handler is a *built-in tool*
(``lingtai.core.soul.handle(agent, args)``), wired live by
``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics``; importing it here would break SDK import-purity
and is unnecessary — this module ships *declarations + an injection seam* only.
The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.soul_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the kernel
intrinsic; the SDK must not import either).

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam.

See ``docs/sdk/architecture-foundation.md`` (stage 3J).

#: Per-action danger grading for the single ``soul`` tool's ``action``
#: discriminator. This is the conservative, faithful encoding of the side effects
#: the real built-in tool performs in code (``intrinsics.soul.__init__.handle``):
#:
#: * **LLM consultation + persisted state** (``CAUTION``) — ``inquiry`` runs a
#:   synchronous mirror-session LLM call and persists the result to
#:   ``logs/soul_inquiry.jsonl`` (and, for ``/btw``-source, ``.notification/btw.json``);
#:   ``flow`` spawns a daemon-thread consultation fire that writes
#:   ``logs/soul_flow.jsonl`` and publishes/clears ``.notification/soul.json``
#:   (in-flight gated by ``agent._soul_fire_lock``). Both do real work with lasting
#:   logs/notifications, but neither tears down or irreversibly destroys state.
#: * **persisted init config** (``CAUTION``) — ``config`` persists soul cadence
#:   knobs (``delay_seconds`` / ``consultation_past_count``) to
#:   ``manifest.soul.*`` in ``init.json`` and restarts the wall-clock timer;
#:   ``voice`` persists the soul voice profile to ``manifest.soul.*``. Lasting
#:   preference writes, recoverable by re-setting.
#: * **notification dismiss** (``CAUTION``) — ``dismiss`` clears the ``soul``
#:   ``.notification/`` surface via the generic dismiss path. A small, self-scoped
#:   side effect — graded ``CAUTION`` to mirror ``system``'s ``dismiss`` (which
#:   also clears one ``.notification/`` surface), not a pure read.
#:
#: Every soul action is ``CAUTION`` — none is a pure read and none is a destructive
#: teardown — so the bundle-level posture (``caution``) equals the strongest
#: action's grade, exactly mirroring ``lifecycle_tools``'s "bundle = strongest"
#: rule.
