"""The ``skills`` catalog bundle declaration + an in-process host seam (stage 3G).

The **skill catalog** counterpart of the ``knowledge`` private-memory bundle
(this same stage) and the ``mcp`` registry-view bundle (stage 3F). Where
:mod:`lingtai_sdk.knowledge_tools` declares the agent's *private* knowledge
catalog, this module declares the single low-side-effect ``skills`` surface — the
agent's **portable skill catalog** view (the structurally isomorphic, physically
separate sibling of ``knowledge``). The module is named ``skill_tools`` (singular)
to match the ``mcp_tools`` / ``communication_tools`` ``<domain>_tools`` convention
without the awkward ``skills_tools`` doubling; the declared *tool* name stays the
live ``skills`` (plural).

Carrier and host class — consistent with the live wiring
--------------------------------------------------------
``skills`` is a **wrapper capability** registered live by its ``setup()`` through
``agent.add_tool`` — the *same* non-native, in-process registration path the file
tools, ``daemon``, ``mcp``, and ``knowledge`` use, **not** a built-in tool. So,
like ``knowledge``, it declares ``in_process`` transport + ``privileged=False`` and
is hosted by the non-native :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost`,
mirroring how the live ``setup()`` path carries it.

Read-only, but **agent-state-sensitive** — why an in-process host, not an
out-of-process transport: the ``info`` action does more than return static text.
It re-scans ``.library/{intrinsic,custom}`` plus the configured Tier-1 ``paths``
and **re-renders the agent's ``skills`` system-prompt section** (``_reconcile``
calls ``agent.update_system_prompt``), reports a runtime health snapshot, and
returns the skills-manual body — all bound to ``agent._working_dir``. That state
coupling (and the Tier-1 ``paths`` the handler closes over) is why it rides the
in-process capability carrier rather than an out-of-process transport. It never
writes to ``.library/`` (installation is the Agent initializer's job) — the
``configuration`` / ``catalog`` posture with an in-process, agent-bound seam,
exactly like ``knowledge`` and ``mcp``.

Single tool, single action — a per-action risk table for symmetry
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``skills`` is a single public tool with an ``action`` discriminator whose live
enum is **``info`` only** (see ``lingtai.core.skills.get_schema``). As with the
other stage-3 bundles, the action grade ships as a small
:data:`SKILLS_ACTION_RISK` table (``info`` → ``SAFE``) plus a
:func:`skills_action_risk` helper that fails safe *high* (an unknown action grades
``DESTRUCTIVE``, never silently ``SAFE``) — a declaration the stage-17 guard bridge
may read, never a second gate. The bundle-level posture equals the strongest
action's grade: ``SAFE``.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in the prior stages, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``skills`` implementation. The real handler is a wrapper capability
closure built by ``lingtai.core.skills.make_handler(agent, paths)`` (bound to a
live ``agent`` and its Tier-1 ``paths``); importing it here would break SDK
import-purity (the SDK must not eagerly pull the wrapper) and is unnecessary —
this module ships *declarations + an injection seam* only:

    skills manifest -> skills_catalog_host(handler)  # wrapper injects make_handler(agent, paths)
       -> host.invoke("skills", **args)              # runs the wrapper capability's dispatch

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.skills_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the wrapper
capability; the SDK must not import either). The tool **schema and behavior are
unchanged**: the bridge reuses ``skills.make_handler`` verbatim, and the live
``setup()`` registration path is untouched.

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam, the skill-
catalog mirror of the prior bundles.
