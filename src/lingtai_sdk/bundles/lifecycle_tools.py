"""High-state lifecycle/``system`` tool bundle declaration + native host seam.

The **high-state counterpart** of :mod:`lingtai_sdk.file_tools` (stage 3A,
read-only) and :mod:`lingtai_sdk.file_mutation_tools` (stage 3B, side-effecting).
Where those declare the *non-privileged, in-process* low-state file tools, this
module is the first declare-and-inject seam for the **privileged, native-only**
``system`` lifecycle surface — the agent's runtime/lifecycle/inter-agent control
tool (refresh / sleep / karma actions / nirvana / notification / dismiss).

Single source of manifest truth
--------------------------------
The ``system`` :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` is **not**
redeclared here. It already exists in :mod:`lingtai_sdk.core_bundles`
(:func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.system_bundle`, stage 8) — ``required`` +
``privileged`` + ``native_only`` + ``NATIVE_ONLY`` + ``native`` transport, one
public ``system`` tool, bundle-level ``danger=destructive``. This module *reuses*
that manifest verbatim (``lifecycle_system_manifest()`` is a thin re-export) so
there is exactly one ``system`` manifest in the SDK, and adds two things on top:

1. a **per-action risk table** (:data:`SYSTEM_ACTION_RISK`) that grades each
   ``system`` action individually, because the single bundle-level
   ``destructive`` posture cannot faithfully express that ``sleep`` (self only,
   no authority) and a privileged ``nirvana`` (irreversible teardown) sit at
   opposite ends of the risk spectrum;
2. a **``system``-specific native host seam**
   (:func:`system_lifecycle_host`) — the privileged-native mirror of
   ``file_tool_host`` / ``file_mutation_tool_host``, wrapping
   :func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.native_core_host` so a host injecting *one*
   real ``system`` handler does not have to also supply ``psyche`` / ``soul``
   (which the all-three :func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.native_core_hosts`
   requires).

Why a per-action risk table, not a per-action manifest
------------------------------------------------------
The ``system`` tool is a single public tool with an ``action`` discriminator, not
one tool per action — so its danger cannot vary per-action at the *manifest*
level without inventing one bundle per action (which would fork the live tool
registration, exactly what this stage must not do). The conservative, faithful
encoding is therefore: keep the **bundle-level posture at its strongest action**
(``destructive`` — what the stage-17 guard bridge already derives), and ship the
**graded action table as metadata** so a host that wants finer-than-bundle
grading can read it *without* any live runtime gate. The grading mirrors the
authority the real built-in tool already enforces in code
(``lingtai.core.system.karma._KARMA_ACTIONS`` /
``_NIRVANA_ACTIONS``); it is a *declaration of* that posture, never a second
gate.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in stages 3A/3B/8, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``system`` implementation. The real handler is a *built-in tool*
(``lingtai.core.system.handle(agent, args)``), wired live by
``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics``; importing it here would break SDK import-purity
(the SDK must not eagerly pull the built-in tool surface) and is unnecessary —
this module ships *declarations + an injection seam* only:

    system manifest (core_bundles.system_bundle)
       -> system_lifecycle_host(handler)   # wrapper injects the real intrinsic handler
       -> host.invoke("system", **args)     # runs the built-in tool's existing dispatch

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies that handler lives in
``lingtai.core.system_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the kernel
intrinsic; the SDK must not import either). The tool **schema and behavior are
unchanged**: the bridge reuses the built-in tool's existing ``handle`` /
``get_schema`` verbatim, and the live ``_wire_intrinsics`` registration path is
untouched.

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam, the high-state
mirror of the low-state file bundles.

See ``docs/sdk/architecture-foundation.md`` (stage 3C).
