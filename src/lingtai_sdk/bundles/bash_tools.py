"""The ``bash`` shell-execution bundle declaration + an in-process host seam (stage 3H).

The **arbitrary-shell-execution** counterpart of the ``daemon`` execution bundle
(stage 3D). Where :mod:`lingtai_sdk.communication_tools` declares ``daemon`` (which
spawns and kills *child agents*), this module declares the single highest-danger
host-process surface — ``bash`` — which runs **arbitrary shell commands** in the
agent's working-directory sandbox and manages background (async) jobs.

Carrier and host class — consistent with the live wiring
--------------------------------------------------------
``bash`` is a **wrapper capability** registered live by its ``setup()`` through
``agent.add_tool`` — the *same* non-native, in-process registration path the file
tools, ``daemon``, ``mcp``, and ``knowledge`` use, **not** a built-in tool. So,
like ``daemon``, it declares ``in_process`` transport + ``privileged=False`` and is
hosted by the non-native :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost`,
mirroring how the live ``setup()`` path carries it. Unlike the read-only catalog
surfaces (``mcp`` / ``knowledge``), it carries the **strongest** danger posture
because running a shell command is, by construction, arbitrary host-side execution.

Single tool, three actions — a per-action risk table
----------------------------------------------------
``bash`` is a single public tool with an ``action`` discriminator whose live enum
is **``run`` / ``poll`` / ``cancel``** (see ``lingtai.core.bash.get_schema``). As
with the other stage-3 bundles, the action grades ship as a small
:data:`BASH_ACTION_RISK` table plus a :func:`bash_action_risk` helper that fails
safe *high* (an unknown action grades ``DESTRUCTIVE``, never silently ``SAFE``) — a
declaration the stage-17 guard bridge may read, never a second gate. The
conservative, faithful encoding of what each action does:

* ``run`` (``DESTRUCTIVE``) — executes an **arbitrary shell command** (sync or, with
  ``async=true``, in a background process group). The defining capability and the
  highest-danger action: it can run anything the host shell can, bounded only by
  the agent's :class:`~lingtai.core.bash.BashPolicy` (which this declaration does
  **not** model — policy is the live handler's concern).
* ``poll`` (``CAUTION``) — checks an async job's status. Mostly read-only, but on
  job completion it reads the captured output **and removes the job directory**
  (``shutil.rmtree``) and closes the held file handles — a bounded local side
  effect, so ``CAUTION`` rather than ``SAFE``.
* ``cancel`` (``DESTRUCTIVE``) — sends ``SIGTERM`` to the job's process group
  (escalating to ``SIGKILL``) and removes the job directory. A process-kill side
  effect, graded ``DESTRUCTIVE`` like ``daemon``'s ``reclaim``.

The bundle-level posture equals the strongest action's grade: ``DESTRUCTIVE`` (the
same posture as ``daemon``), faithful to ``bash`` being arbitrary host execution.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in the prior stages, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``bash`` implementation. The real handler is the ``handle`` method of
a :class:`~lingtai.core.bash.BashManager` built by
``lingtai.core.bash.make_handler(agent)`` (bound to a live ``agent`` and a resolved
policy); importing it here would break SDK import-purity (the SDK must not eagerly
pull the wrapper) and is unnecessary — this module ships *declarations + an
injection seam* only:

    bash manifest -> bash_exec_host(handler)   # wrapper injects make_handler(agent)
       -> host.invoke("bash", **args)          # runs the wrapper capability's dispatch

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.bash_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the wrapper
capability; the SDK must not import either). The tool **schema and behavior are
unchanged**: the bridge reuses ``bash.make_handler`` verbatim, and the live
``setup()`` registration path is untouched.

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam, the
arbitrary-shell-execution mirror of the prior bundles.
