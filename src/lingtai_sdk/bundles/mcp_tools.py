"""The ``mcp`` tool-config/catalog bundle declaration + an in-process host seam (stage 3F).

The **tool-config / catalog** counterpart of the file/lifecycle/communication
bundle templates. Where :mod:`lingtai_sdk.communication_tools` declares the
high-state ``email`` / ``daemon`` surfaces (external / process side effects), this
module declares the single low-side-effect ``mcp`` surface — the agent's
**per-agent MCP-server registry view**.

Why ``mcp`` is here now (it was excluded in stage 3D)
-----------------------------------------------------
At stage 3D ``mcp`` was *excluded* on two grounds: its live handler was an inline
closure inside ``setup()`` with no stable extractable seam, and its single
``show`` action is read-only presentation. Stage 3F resolves the first: the
wrapper now exposes a stable ``lingtai.core.mcp.make_handler(agent)`` factory (the
single source of truth ``setup()`` itself registers), so the surface has an
extractable seam exactly like ``daemon.make_handler``. The read-only nature is
preserved here — it is precisely *why* this is the lowest-risk high-altitude
surface to bridge, and why the bundle declares ``SecurityDanger.SAFE``.

Carrier and host class — consistent with the live wiring
--------------------------------------------------------
``mcp`` is a **wrapper capability** registered live by its ``setup()`` through
``agent.add_tool`` — the *same* non-native, in-process registration path the file
tools and ``daemon`` use, **not** a built-in tool. So, like ``daemon`` (and
unlike the native-carried ``email`` / ``system``), it declares ``in_process``
transport + ``privileged=False`` and is hosted by the non-native
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost`, mirroring how the live ``setup()``
path carries it.

Read-only, but **agent-state-sensitive** — why an in-process host, not an
out-of-process stdio/http transport: the ``show`` action does more than return
static catalog text. It re-reads the on-disk ``mcp_registry.jsonl`` and
**re-renders the agent's ``mcp`` system-prompt section** (``_reconcile`` calls
``agent.update_system_prompt``) and reports a runtime health snapshot bound to
``agent._working_dir``. That state coupling is why it rides the in-process
capability carrier (the handler closes over a live ``agent``) rather than an
out-of-process transport a stateless catalog server could use. It is read-only
(no registry write, no MCP server start) yet not a pure static read — the
``configuration`` / ``catalog`` posture with an in-process, agent-bound seam.

Single tool, single action — a per-action risk table for symmetry
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``mcp`` is a single public tool with an ``action`` discriminator whose live enum
is **``show`` only** (see ``lingtai.core.mcp.get_schema``). As with the other
stage-3 bundles, the action grade ships as a small :data:`MCP_ACTION_RISK` table
(``show`` → ``SAFE``) plus an :func:`mcp_action_risk` helper that fails safe
*high* (an unknown action grades ``DESTRUCTIVE``, never silently ``SAFE``) — a
declaration the stage-17 guard bridge may read, never a second gate. The
bundle-level posture equals the strongest action's grade: ``SAFE``.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in the prior stages, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``mcp`` implementation. The real handler is a wrapper capability
closure built by ``lingtai.core.mcp.make_handler(agent)`` (bound to a live
``agent``); importing it here would break SDK import-purity (the SDK must not
eagerly pull the wrapper) and is unnecessary — this module ships *declarations +
an injection seam* only:

    mcp manifest -> mcp_config_host(handler)   # wrapper injects the real make_handler(agent)
       -> host.invoke("mcp", **args)            # runs the wrapper capability's existing dispatch

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.mcp_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the kernel/
wrapper capability; the SDK must not import either). The tool **schema and
behavior are unchanged**: the bridge reuses ``mcp.make_handler`` verbatim, and the
live ``setup()`` registration path is untouched.

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam, the
tool-config/catalog mirror of the prior bundles.
