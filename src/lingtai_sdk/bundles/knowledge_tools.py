"""The ``knowledge`` catalog bundle declaration + an in-process host seam (stage 3G).

The **private-memory catalog** counterpart of the ``mcp`` registry-view bundle
(stage 3F). Where :mod:`lingtai_sdk.mcp_tools` declares the agent's per-agent
MCP-server registry view, this module declares the single bounded-side-effect
``knowledge`` surface — the agent's **private, durable knowledge catalog** view
(the structurally isomorphic, physically separate sibling of the ``skills``
catalog declared in :mod:`lingtai_sdk.skill_tools`).

Carrier and host class — consistent with the live wiring
--------------------------------------------------------
``knowledge`` is a **wrapper capability** registered live by its ``setup()``
through ``agent.add_tool`` — the *same* non-native, in-process registration path
the file tools, ``daemon``, and ``mcp`` use, **not** a built-in tool. So, like
``mcp``, it declares ``in_process`` transport + ``privileged=False`` and is hosted
by the non-native :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost`, mirroring how
the live ``setup()`` path carries it.

Bounded-side-effect and **agent-state-sensitive** — why an in-process host, not an
out-of-process transport: the ``info`` action does more than return static text.
It re-scans ``<agent>/knowledge/`` and **re-renders the agent's ``knowledge``
system-prompt section** (``_reconcile`` calls ``agent.update_system_prompt``) and
reports a runtime health snapshot bound to ``agent._working_dir``. That state
coupling is why it rides the in-process capability carrier (the handler closes
over a live ``agent``) rather than an out-of-process transport a stateless catalog
server could use. It is normally read-only of the agent's *authored* knowledge, but the live
``_reconcile`` path still owns a one-time legacy-JSON migration that can write
migrated ``KNOWLEDGE.md`` entries and rename the legacy JSON file. That bounded
filesystem side effect is why the action is graded ``CAUTION`` — the ``configuration`` / ``catalog`` posture with an
in-process, agent-bound seam, exactly like ``mcp``.

Single tool, single action — a per-action risk table for symmetry
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``knowledge`` is a single public tool with an ``action`` discriminator whose live
enum is **``info`` only** (see ``lingtai.core.knowledge.get_schema``). As with the
other stage-3 bundles, the action grade ships as a small
:data:`KNOWLEDGE_ACTION_RISK` table (``info`` → ``CAUTION``) plus a
:func:`knowledge_action_risk` helper that fails safe *high* (an unknown action
grades ``DESTRUCTIVE``, never silently ``SAFE``) — a declaration the stage-17 guard
bridge may read, never a second gate. The bundle-level posture equals the
strongest action's grade: ``CAUTION``.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in the prior stages, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or
call the real ``knowledge`` implementation. The real handler is a wrapper
capability closure built by ``lingtai.core.knowledge.make_handler(agent)`` (bound
to a live ``agent``); importing it here would break SDK import-purity (the SDK must
not eagerly pull the wrapper) and is unnecessary — this module ships
*declarations + an injection seam* only:

    knowledge manifest -> knowledge_catalog_host(handler)  # wrapper injects make_handler(agent)
       -> host.invoke("knowledge", **args)                 # runs the wrapper capability's dispatch

The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.knowledge_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the
wrapper capability; the SDK must not import either). The tool **schema and
behavior are unchanged**: the bridge reuses ``knowledge.make_handler`` verbatim,
and the live ``setup()`` registration path is untouched.

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam, the catalog
mirror of the prior bundles.
