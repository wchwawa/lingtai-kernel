"""Pure SDK ``BundleManifest`` → kernel ``GuardCheck`` bridge (stage 17).

A :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` already declares a per-bundle
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.SecurityDanger` posture (``safe`` / ``caution``
/ ``destructive``) over its named tools. This module is the thin, import-light
adapter that turns one or more manifests into kernel
:mod:`lingtai_kernel.tool_call_guard` primitives — a :data:`GuardCheck` callable
and a ready :class:`ToolCallGuard` chain — so the existing ``ToolExecutor`` guard
seam (stage 16) can consult declared bundle posture *before* a tool is
dispatched, without any executor / ``BaseAgent`` / wrapper ``Agent`` change.

Dependency direction is one-way: the SDK imports the dependency-light kernel
``tool_call_guard`` types; the kernel never imports the SDK. This stage wires
**nothing** into a live wrapper/Agent (no C3 behavior-visible runtime change) —
it only builds the callable a later stage can choose to install.

Policy (deliberately narrow, deterministic, fail-open)
------------------------------------------------------
The map from a manifest's declared danger posture to a guard decision is:

* ``safe``        → **allow**, clean pass-through (the check returns ``None`` so
  the chain collapses to the unchanged ``default_allow`` pass-through — no
  advisory noise on read-only/pure tools);
* ``caution``     → **allow but warn** (a ``warn``/``warning`` advisory carrying
  the bundle name + declared danger, never blocking);
* ``destructive`` → policy-mode dependent:
    * :attr:`GuardPolicyMode.BLOCKING` (the default) → **deny**;
    * :attr:`GuardPolicyMode.ADVISORY` → **allow but warn**;
* an **unknown** tool (declared by no supplied manifest) → **allow** (fail open,
  clean pass-through). The bridge never fails closed: a tool it cannot place is
  always allowed, so installing it can only ever *add* denials for explicitly
  declared destructive surfaces, never break an undeclared tool.

When two manifests declare the *same* tool name with different danger postures,
the **most dangerous** posture wins (``destructive`` > ``caution`` > ``safe``),
so a benign alias can never silently downgrade a destructive tool.
