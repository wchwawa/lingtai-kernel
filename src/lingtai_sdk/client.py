"""Thin public client facade over the runtime contract.

This module is intentionally small and runtime-agnostic. It does not implement a
new backend and it does not import the wrapper ``lingtai`` package. Instead it
wraps the stage-0 :mod:`lingtai_sdk.runtime` contract with a convenient
``LingTaiClient.query(...)`` call that works with any supplied
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.runtime.Runtime`.

If no runtime is supplied, the default native runtime is imported lazily at
client construction time. Even then the wrapper ``Agent`` is not imported until a
native session is started.
