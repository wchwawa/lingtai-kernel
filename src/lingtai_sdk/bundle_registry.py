"""The declared-bundle registry / dispatch-target seam (stage 3K).

Stages 3A–3J declared every SDK capability bundle in its own per-domain module
and gave each its own ``<domain>_manifests()`` aggregator — but nothing
collected those aggregators into a single, canonical view of *the whole declared
set*. Each consumer that wanted "all the bundles" (the stage-17
:mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge`, a future live runtime's tool router) had to
re-derive the union by importing and concatenating the domain modules by hand.

This module is that missing connective tissue, and *only* that:

* :func:`all_bundle_manifests` enumerates every declared SDK bundle manifest
  **once**, in a stable, documented order (core → file read → file mutation →
  communication → tool-config/catalog → shell → peer-spawn). The privileged
  core ``system`` / ``psyche`` / ``soul`` are sourced from
  :mod:`lingtai_sdk.core_bundles` (their single source of truth), not from the
  ``lifecycle_tools`` / ``psyche_tools`` / ``soul_tools`` modules that merely
  re-export them — so a core bundle is never double-counted.
* :class:`BundleRegistry` validates that union and indexes it two ways — by
  bundle ``name`` and by declared tool name — enforcing one invariant the
  per-domain modules cannot see on their own: **no two bundles share a name, and
  no two bundles declare the same tool**. A duplicate is a :class:`BundleLoadError`,
  never a silent last-writer-wins.
* :meth:`BundleRegistry.dispatch_target` turns a tool name into a
  :class:`DispatchTarget` (the owning bundle name, its manifest, and the
  declared :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.SecurityDanger` posture) — the
  read-only lookup a tool router or guard installer consults *before* dispatch.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
It declares no new bundle and migrates no implementation. It builds **no hosts**
and holds **no handlers** — dispatch here means *"which bundle declares this
tool"*, not *"call the tool"*. Wiring real handlers, choosing which bundles gate
a live agent, and installing a guard remain the deferred, higher-risk live-wiring
slices (see ``docs/sdk/architecture-foundation.md``). Import-pure: it imports
only the import-pure declaration siblings + ``.capabilities`` + ``.errors``, so
``import lingtai_sdk.bundle_registry`` pulls in no ``lingtai`` wrapper module and
no provider SDK.
