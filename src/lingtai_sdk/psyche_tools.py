"""High-state ``psyche`` identity/context bundle declaration + native host seam.

The privileged, native-only mirror of :mod:`lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools` (the
``system`` lifecycle surface, stage 3C) for the **second** core surface — the
agent's identity, working-notes (pad), and conversation-context (molt) tool.
Where ``lifecycle_tools`` is the high-state template for ``system``, this module
is the same template applied to ``psyche``: the agent's "bare essentials of self"
(edit/load identity ``lingtai.md``, edit/load/pin the pad sketchboard, molt the
conversation context, and naming).

Single source of manifest truth
--------------------------------
The ``psyche`` :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` is **not**
redeclared here. It already exists in :mod:`lingtai_sdk.core_bundles`
(:func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.psyche_bundle`, stage 8) — ``required`` +
``privileged`` + ``native_only`` + ``NATIVE_ONLY`` + ``native`` transport, one
public ``psyche`` tool, bundle-level ``danger=destructive``. This module *reuses*
that manifest verbatim (``psyche_identity_manifest()`` is a thin re-export) so
there is exactly one ``psyche`` manifest in the SDK, and adds two things on top:

1. a **per-(object, action) risk table** (:data:`PSYCHE_OBJECT_ACTION_RISK`) that
   grades each ``psyche`` ``(object, action)`` pair individually. Unlike
   ``system`` (a flat ``action`` discriminator), the live ``psyche`` tool
   dispatches on an ``(object, action)`` pair (see
   ``lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.psyche._VALID_ACTIONS`` / ``_DISPATCH``), so the
   table is keyed by that pair. A single bundle-level ``caution`` posture cannot
   faithfully express that ``pad.load`` / ``lingtai.load`` are pure reads while
   ``name.set`` writes the **immutable** true name (set-once, irreversible);
2. a **``psyche``-specific native host seam** (:func:`psyche_identity_host`) — the
   privileged-native mirror of ``system_lifecycle_host``, wrapping
   :func:`~lingtai_sdk.core_bundles.native_core_host` so a host injecting *one*
   real ``psyche`` handler does not have to also supply ``system`` / ``soul``.

Why a per-(object, action) table, not a per-pair manifest
---------------------------------------------------------
The ``psyche`` tool is a single public tool with ``(object, action)``
discriminators, not one tool per pair — so its danger cannot vary per-pair at the
*manifest* level without inventing one bundle per pair (which would fork the live
tool registration, exactly what this stage must not do). The conservative,
faithful encoding is therefore: set the **bundle-level posture to ``destructive``**
(the strongest per-pair grade, mirroring the other stage-3 bundle posture rule),
and ship the **graded pair table as metadata** so a host that wants finer-than-
bundle grading can read it *without* any live runtime gate. The grading mirrors the
side effects the real kernel intrinsic already performs in code; it is a
*declaration of* that posture, never a second gate.

Note the table grades the one **irreversible** pair ``name.set`` ``DESTRUCTIVE``;
that strongest grade is also the bundle posture. The per-pair table still refines
within the single ``psyche`` tool — downward for pure reads (``*.load`` → ``SAFE``)
and to ``CAUTION`` for lasting-but-recoverable writes. Like every stage-3 risk
helper, the lookup fails safe **high** (an unknown object/action grades
``DESTRUCTIVE``).

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
Exactly as in stages 3A/3B/3C/8, it does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import,
or call the real ``psyche`` implementation. The real handler is a *kernel
intrinsic* (``lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.psyche.handle(agent, args)``), wired live
by ``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics``; importing it here would break SDK
import-purity and is unnecessary — this module ships *declarations + an injection
seam* only. The wrapper-side bridge that supplies the handler lives in
``lingtai.core.psyche_bundle`` (the wrapper *may* import the SDK and the kernel
intrinsic; the SDK must not import either).

This stage wires **nothing** into live tool dispatch and installs **no** guard on
any agent — it is purely additive declaration + an injection seam.

See ``docs/sdk/architecture-foundation.md`` (stage 3J).
