"""Core capability-bundle manifests: ``system`` / ``psyche`` / ``soul``.

The first deliberate contact with the privileged core surfaces — but **only as
a manifest contract plus a stub-injection seam**. This module declares the three
required, privileged, native-only core bundles as :class:`BundleManifest`
objects and offers a thin adapter that turns a core manifest plus an *injected*
handler callable into a native-authority :class:`NativeBundleHost`.

What this module is NOT
-----------------------
It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the existing
``system`` / ``psyche`` / ``soul`` implementations, and it does not touch the
kernel turn loop. The real privileged handlers are supplied by the native
runtime in a *later* stage; here the adapter only enforces the
manifest/handler/native-authority contract around a *supplied* callable. A
freshly-imported ``core_bundles`` pulls in nothing from the ``lingtai`` wrapper
(import-pure; imports only the import-pure ``.capabilities`` /
``.capability_host`` / ``.errors`` siblings).

The three manifests share the same role posture — ``required=True``,
``privileged=True``, ``native_only=True``,
``backend_replaceability=NATIVE_ONLY``, ``transport.kind == native`` — and each
declares exactly one public tool (``system`` / ``psyche`` / ``soul``). They
differ only in their declared danger posture, mirroring the real surfaces:

* ``system`` — ``destructive`` (lifecycle control incl. irreversible teardown);
* ``psyche`` — ``destructive`` (identity/context control includes set-once true-name writes);
* ``soul``   — ``caution`` (inner-voice consultation plus persisted flow/voice config).
