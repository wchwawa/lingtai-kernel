"""DeepSeek adapter — thin OpenAI-compat wrapper that satisfies the
reasoning_content round-trip contract for thinking mode.

DeepSeek V4 thinking mode rejects requests missing ``reasoning_content``
on assistant turns once thinking has been triggered. Omitting it returns
HTTP 400:

    "The `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode must be passed back
     to the API."

The actual contract (determined empirically — the docs understate it):

    Once any assistant turn in the conversation has tool_calls, ALL
    subsequent assistant turns (tool-call AND plain-text) must carry
    reasoning_content when replayed.

Assistant turns BEFORE the first tool_call don't need it. After the
first tool_call, every assistant turn needs it — including the final
plain-text reply that followed the tool loop.

Real reasoning is preserved end-to-end now. The OpenAI adapter captures
``reasoning_content`` into a ThinkingBlock on every assistant turn
(``openai/adapter.py``); ``interface_converters.to_openai`` emits the
ThinkingBlock back as ``reasoning_content`` on replay. The historical
"byte-identical placeholder" approach (commits afc7ddc → 86c2a3d)
caused DeepSeek's cache fast-path to collapse onto the placeholder
string, producing empty responses (issue #9). Real per-turn reasoning
is byte-different by construction and avoids the collapse.

The only remaining responsibility of this adapter is the **fallback**:
if an assistant turn replayed from history has no captured ThinkingBlock
(e.g. chat_history.jsonl entries written before this fix shipped, or
entries where the provider returned no reasoning text at all), inject a
per-turn-unique stub so DeepSeek's field-presence validator is satisfied
without re-introducing the cache-collapse pattern.

Everything else inherits from ``OpenAIAdapter`` / ``OpenAIChatSession``
unchanged via the ``_build_messages`` and ``_session_class`` hook points
on the parent.
