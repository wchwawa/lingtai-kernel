"""Shared bundled-skill (SKILL.md) helpers for curated MCP servers.

Each curated MCP ships a standard skill file (``SKILL.md``: YAML frontmatter +
markdown body) in its package folder. The ``manual`` tool action reads the full
body on demand (progressive disclosure), while the frontmatter ``name`` +
``description`` are injected into the tool schema's ``manual`` action line as a
catalog entry. This module factors out the tiny frontmatter parser, the loader,
the schema catalog line, and the ``action='manual'`` payload so every MCP can
share one understandable implementation instead of copying Telegram's.

The original Telegram MCP keeps its own inline copy of this logic for historical
reasons; new/curated MCPs use this shared helper.
