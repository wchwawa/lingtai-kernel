# Feishu (Lark) MCP — usage manual (progressive disclosure)

This manual is pulled on demand via `action='manual'` so the per-action tool
schema can stay concise. Read it when you need detail beyond the one-line action
descriptions; you do not need to call it before every send.

## RECIPIENTS: receive_id / receive_id_type

- `send` targets a recipient by `receive_id` plus `receive_id_type`. Use
  `receive_id_type='open_id'` for an individual user (`ou_xxx`) and
  `receive_id_type='chat_id'` for a group chat (`oc_xxx`). `receive_id_type`
  defaults to `open_id` when omitted.
- `email`, `user_id`, and `union_id` are also accepted as `receive_id_type`
  values when you only have that identifier for a user.

## SEND vs REPLY

- `reply` (`message_id` from read/check results, `text`) threads your response to
  a specific incoming message; prefer it when answering a particular message.
- `send` (`receive_id`, `receive_id_type`, `text`) starts a fresh message; use it
  for unsolicited or standalone messages.

## READING: check / read / search

- `check`: list recent conversations with unread counts (optional `account`).
- `read`: read messages from one chat (`chat_id`; optional `limit`, `account`).
- `search`: regex search over inbox messages (`query`; optional `account`,
  `chat_id`).

## PLACEHOLDER / PROGRESS

- For responses that take more than ~5s, send `action='send'` with
  `placeholder=true` and your interim text. This returns a compound `message_id`.
- Update it later with `action='edit'`, `message_id=<that id>`, `text=<final>`
  instead of sending a second message, so the user sees one evolving reply.

## CONTACTS / ACCOUNTS

- `contacts`: list saved contacts (optional `account`).
- `add_contact`: save a contact alias (`open_id`, `alias`; optional `name`,
  `chat_id`). Saving an alias does not grant inbound permission on its own.
- `remove_contact`: remove a contact (`alias` or `open_id`).
- `accounts`: list configured app accounts.

## MESSAGE IDS

- `message_id` is the compound id returned by read/check
  (`{alias}:{chat_id}:{feishu_message_id}`); pass it back verbatim to
  `reply`/`edit`/`delete`.

## SIDE EFFECTS & ERROR SURFACING

- `send`, `reply`, and `edit` deliver to real users — they are external
  side effects, so confirm recipient and content before sending unsolicited
  messages.
- Actions return a result dict on success or `{'error': <message>}` on failure
  (e.g. missing `receive_id`, bad `message_id`). Check for the `'error'` key and
  surface or act on it rather than assuming delivery.
