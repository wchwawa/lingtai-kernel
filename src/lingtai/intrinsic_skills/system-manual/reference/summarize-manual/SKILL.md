# Summarize Manual

`system(action="summarize")` is context hygiene for completed tool results. It
replaces the context-visible copy of one or more prior tool-result blocks with
your own summary. It does **not** delete the original event; the raw result
remains in logs for fallback.

Use this manual when runtime guidance tells you to summarize, when a
`large_tool_result` reminder appears, when tool output has served its immediate
purpose, or when you need to explain how summarize differs from molt.

## 1 · The principle: progressive disclosure

A raw tool result is the first layer: it is useful while you inspect it. After
you have consumed it, the better layer is an index that future-you can reason
from without carrying the raw bulk.

A good summary should let future-you decide whether the hidden raw result must
be reopened. Preserve:

- the conclusion or decision;
- key evidence, measurements, or error text;
- paths, URLs, message IDs, tool_call_ids, commit hashes, job IDs, and other
  anchors;
- validation status and commands/tests run;
- risks, caveats, and unresolved questions;
- next steps.

Do not write casual one-liners for consequential results. The summary is the
progressive-disclosure entry point.

## 2 · The two summarize cadences

### Urgent cadence: summarize the bulky result now

Use this when a tool result is long, noisy, or raises a `large_tool_result`
reminder.

1. Read or inspect the result first.
2. Decide what future-you needs from it.
3. On a later step, call `system(action="summarize")` on the completed prior
   result. Do not try to summarize the current result in the same tool batch
   before it exists.
4. Batch several already-digested results in one summarize call when convenient.

### Idle cleanup cadence: sweep what is already consumed

Use this when the task quiets down, before the context window becomes urgent.
Look back over older tool results that are already digested, obsolete, or only
useful as evidence anchors, and replace them with summaries. This keeps active
context small enough that the next task starts clean.

Idle cleanup is also the right time to prepare for a deliberate molt. If
substantial work is complete, durable stores are tended, and no human reply is
pending, prefer molting while context is still cheap over waiting until pressure
warnings force the issue.

## 3 · How to call summarize

Summarize prior completed tool results only:

```json
{
  "action": "summarize",
  "items": [
    {
      "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
      "summary": "What future-you needs: conclusion, evidence, anchors, validation, risks, next steps."
    }
  ]
}
```

Operational rules:

- `tool_call_id` is the producer call ID shown on the original result, not the
  visible `_tool_call_id` event ref.
- A successful summarize replaces only the active-context copy; it does not
  mutate the original event log.
- If a large-result notification points at that result, successful summarize
  clears the reminder.
- If the result is still ambiguous, reopen or inspect it before summarizing.

## 4 · Recovering the original result

A summarized block should carry a retrieval hint. The usual fallback is to search
the agent event log by the preserved `tool_call_id`:

```bash
grep 'call_abc123' <workdir>/logs/events.jsonl
```

For structured trace work, use the SQLite/log tooling documented in
`reference/sqlite-log-query/SKILL.md`, for example `lingtai-agent log query`, to
locate the event and inspect nearby context.

If the original was a spill result, the log entry or summary should also point to
the spill path under `tmp/tool-results/`. Preserve that path in the summary.

## 5 · Good and bad uses

Good uses:

- a large test output after you know which tests passed/failed;
- a long file read after extracting the relevant lines and path;
- a search sweep after preserving matched files and decisions;
- a channel read after responding and keeping the message IDs that matter;
- a resolved error once the recovery path is known.

Bad uses:

- summarizing before you have read or understood the result;
- hiding evidence that you still need to inspect line by line;
- replacing a required deliverable with a vague recap;
- assuming summarize is a durable memory layer.

## 6 · Summarize is not molt

`system(action="summarize")` reduces active-context bulk for selected tool
results. It does not update pad, character, knowledge, skills, or the
session-journal, and it does not shed the conversation.

Molt is a psyche operation. It preserves durable stores, writes the session
journal and molt briefing, and starts a fresh conversation context. Before
molting, read `psyche-manual` and follow its required checklist.

Use them together:

1. Summarize bulky consumed tool results so the active context is navigable.
2. Tend durable stores for facts, procedures, identity changes, and current plan.
3. Molt deliberately while you still have enough context to write a good
   briefing, not only when warnings become urgent.
