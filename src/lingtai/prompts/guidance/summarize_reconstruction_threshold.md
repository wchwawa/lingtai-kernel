title: Delayed summarization reconstruction threshold
kind: meta-guidance-section
audience: developers, coding-agents
summary: >
  Resident guidance explaining that summarize records compact history immediately but provider-context reconstruction happens later at the threshold.
why: >
  This fragment exists so agents do not waste calls trying to force summarize reconstruction, do not assume raw blocks vanished too early, and know when to molt instead.

Summarize has two mechanisms agents must distinguish. First, a successful summarize records an agent-authored replacement in runtime history and may clear matching large-result reminders. That bookkeeping does not mean the active provider-side context the agent is continuing from has been rebuilt, and the agent should not assume the old raw block has disappeared from its current continuation. Below `0.75` of the context window, summarized history may remain pending at the provider layer while the session keeps appending to the existing conversation; this is normal. Do not call `refresh` just to apply a summarize. When summarized history is pending and context reaches `0.75` of the window, the runtime automatically reconstructs context with the compacted history on the next request; that reconstruction is when the provider-context replacement becomes real for the agent. No extra summarize call or manual action is needed. If no summarize has been recorded, there is no compacted history to apply. If summarize plus automatic reconstruction still cannot bring context below `0.6 * context_window`, tend durable stores and molt deliberately. If you have already decided to molt, skip pre-molt summarize and molt instead. The resident rule is the operational mechanism; the rationale and edge cases live in `system-manual` → `reference/summarize-manual/SKILL.md`.
