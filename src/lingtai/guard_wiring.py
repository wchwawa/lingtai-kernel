"""Advisory-first wrapper wiring of the SDK guard bridge (stage 18, C3).

Stage 17 built a pure, import-light SDK adapter
(:mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge`) that turns one or more
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` objects into a kernel
:class:`~lingtai.kernel.tool_call_guard.ToolCallGuard` — but wired *nothing* into
a live agent. This module is the thin wrapper-layer seam that finally installs
such a guard onto the Stage-16 ``BaseAgent._tool_call_guard`` slot, so the turn
loop's ``ToolExecutor`` consults declared bundle posture before a tool is
dispatched.

Behaviour contract (deliberately advisory-first / fail-open)
------------------------------------------------------------
* **Default live mode is advisory.** :data:`DEFAULT_LIVE_GUARD_MODE` is
  :attr:`~lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge.GuardPolicyMode.ADVISORY`: a manifest-declared
  ``destructive`` tool is surfaced as a *warning*, never denied, in default live
  wiring. Blocking is reachable only by an explicit ``mode=`` opt-in and is never
  the wrapper default.
* **Default agents use the canonical SDK bundle registry.** Stage 3K adds a
  name/tool-indexed registry over all declared SDK bundles; default live wiring
  installs an advisory guard from that registry so every declared caution /
  destructive surface warns consistently. Safe tools still pass through cleanly.
* **Unknown / unmanifested tools fail open.** MCP tools, ``add_tool`` tools, and
  any tool without a declared SDK bundle are unknown to the bridge and pass
  through cleanly — this slice can only ever *add advisories* for explicitly
  declared surfaces, never block an undeclared tool.
* **No lifecycle/system tool is blocked.** Because the live mode is advisory,
  even a destructive core tool (e.g. ``system``) would only warn, never deny.
* **Fail open on any error.** If manifest collection or guard construction
  raises, the seam is left at its existing safe value rather than failing closed.

Import direction
----------------
The wrapper (``src/lingtai/...``) may import the SDK bridge/types; the kernel
must stay SDK-free. This module therefore imports
:mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge` (a wrapper→SDK edge, which is allowed), and the
kernel never imports it back.
