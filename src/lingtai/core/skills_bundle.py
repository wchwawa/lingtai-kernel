"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``skills`` tool through the SDK
catalog bundle declaration (stage 3G).

The skill-catalog counterpart of ``lingtai.core.knowledge_bundle`` (the
``knowledge`` private-memory bridge, this same stage) and ``lingtai.core.mcp_bundle``
(the ``mcp`` registry-view bridge, stage 3F). The SDK module
:mod:`lingtai_sdk.skill_tools` *declares* the ``skills`` catalog surface as a
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` and offers a host injection seam,
but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must not import the wrapper, and the
kernel must never import the SDK) — it ships **no real handler**. This module is
where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK and the wrapper capability, injects
the genuine handler and so proves the catalog bundle-execution pattern end to end
against actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
``skills`` is a **wrapper capability** (like ``knowledge``, ``mcp``, ``daemon``, and
the file tools), not a kernel intrinsic. Its real handler is the closure
``lingtai.core.skills.make_handler(agent, paths)`` builds — the *same* closure
``skills.setup()`` registers via ``agent.add_tool`` (single source of truth; see
``lingtai.core.skills.make_handler``). The bridge reuses that *same* factory —
there is no second implementation. The bundle-hosted ``skills`` tool runs
byte-identical logic to the tool ``setup()`` registers, against the same
``agent._working_dir`` / ``.library`` and the same Tier-1 ``paths`` and
``_reconcile`` (scan ``.library/`` + paths → re-render the ``skills`` system-prompt
section → manual body + health snapshot) semantics. The bridge lives in the
wrapper — not the kernel/SDK — because the dependency direction is one-way: the
wrapper *may* import the SDK (``lingtai_sdk.skill_tools``) and the wrapper
capability; the **kernel/SDK must never import the wrapper**. Putting the SDK
import here (lazily, inside the bridge functions) preserves that one-way
``wrapper -> sdk`` edge.

The Tier-1 ``paths`` contract
-----------------------------
Unlike ``mcp`` / ``knowledge`` (whose handlers bind to *agent* alone), the
``skills`` handler also closes over the Tier-1 ``paths`` from ``init.json``
``manifest.capabilities.skills.paths``. The bridge accepts the same optional
``paths`` argument and threads it to ``skills.make_handler`` verbatim — so a host
built with the same ``paths`` the live ``setup()`` saw dispatches byte-identically.
Omitting ``paths`` (the common direct-``Agent`` case) scans only the per-agent
``.library/``, exactly as live ``setup()`` does without kwargs.

The SDK ``BundleHost`` invokes its handler with keyword args; the wrapper
``skills`` handler takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny ``_kwargs_adapter``
reconciles the two without changing either contract — the identical adapter the
file / lifecycle / communication / mcp / knowledge bridges use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the
``skills`` tool — ``skills.setup()`` remains the live path. It is an additive,
observable seam. Constructing the bridge host writes nothing — only an explicit
``host.invoke("skills", action="info")`` re-reconciles, exactly as the live path
does. Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
