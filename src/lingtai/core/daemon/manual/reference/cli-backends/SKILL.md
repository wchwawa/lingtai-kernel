# Daemon CLI Backend Reference

Nested daemon-manual reference. Open this when choosing a daemon backend,
inspecting `daemon(action="list")`, or passing CLI flags through `backend_options`.

## API note: `daemon(action="list")`

`list` reports only currently-active emanations (in-memory registry). It includes
`run_id` and `path` so you know where to read on disk. Historical
(completed/failed/cancelled) emanations don't appear in `list` — find them by
inspecting the agent's `daemons/` folder.

## CLI backends

The `backend` parameter selects the execution engine for emanations. Default is
`lingtai` (the built-in ChatSession loop). External CLI backends are also
available:

| Backend | CLI command | Session resume | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| `lingtai` | (built-in) | N/A — in-process `ask` | Default. Uses preset resolution, tool surface curation, model routing. |
| `claude` | interactive `claude --settings <hook-json>` under a PTY | interactive `claude --resume <claude_session_id> --settings <hook-json>` via `ask` (async) | Experimental interactive Claude Code backend. LingTai drives the TUI through a PTY, answers terminal probes, uses `SessionStart`/`Stop` hooks for synchronization, and reads Claude's transcript JSONL for the daemon result. It does **not** mutate Claude global config, auto-login, handle MFA/tokens, or automate `claude.ai/code`. |
| `claude-interactive` | same as `claude` | same as `claude` | Compatibility/descriptive alias for `claude`. Prefer `claude` for new calls unless you want the explicit experimental name in artifacts. |
| `claude-p` | `claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose --name <em_id> <task>` | `claude --resume <claude_session_id> --print ...` via `ask` (async — returns immediately, reply arrives via notification / `check`) | Explicit name for the existing print-mode Claude Code backend. Session ID is captured from stream-json output, so `ask` is usable as soon as `emanate` returns. |
| `claude-code` | same as `claude-p` | same as `claude-p` | Backward-compatible alias retained for existing callers and stored daemon entries. |
| `codex` | `codex exec --json --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox <task>` | `codex exec resume <codex_session_id>` via `ask` (async — returns immediately, reply arrives via notification / `check`) | Mirrors the print-mode Claude backend. `thread.started` event carries the session id (codex internally calls it `thread_id`), captured immediately. `ask` resumes the same conversation context. |
| `opencode` | `opencode run --format json <prompt>` | `opencode run --session <opencode_session_id> ...` via `ask` (async) | Uses opencode's session id/event vocabulary. |
| `cursor` | `agent -p <prompt>` | `agent -p --resume <cursor_session_id> ...` via `ask` (async) | Cursor Agent CLI backend. |

**When to use CLI backends:** Use them when the task benefits from a different
agent runtime's tool surface (for example Claude Code's built-in file editing or
Codex's sandboxed execution) rather than the LingTai emanation's curated tool
set.

**Claude backend naming:** `claude` is the interactive PTY/TUI backend.
`claude-p` is the print-mode backend that wraps Claude Code's official
`--print`/stream-json mode. `claude-code` remains a compatibility alias for
`claude-p` so older calls and persisted daemon entries keep working.

**Claude Code auth environment hygiene.** All Claude backends (`claude`,
`claude-interactive`, `claude-p`, and compatibility `claude-code`) start
`claude` with auth override variables stripped from the subprocess environment.
This includes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (which force API
billing; GH #107) and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (a stale inherited token can
override a refreshed `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and appear as a false
"weekly limit"; see Lingtai-AI/lingtai#189). If a manual shell invocation of
`claude` reports a quota/weekly-limit error, run a tiny smoke test with the stale
env token unset before concluding the account is actually exhausted:

```bash
env -u CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN claude -p 'Reply exactly OK' --allowedTools Read -c
```

Do not print token values while diagnosing; `claude auth status` plus redacted
environment variable names are enough.

**CLI backends skip preset resolution** — the external CLI manages its own model,
tools, and permissions. The `tools` field in the task spec is ignored for CLI
backends.

## Passing free-form CLI flags via `backend_options`

For CLI backends, each task may carry an optional `backend_options` JSON object
that is converted to argv tokens and appended to the CLI command before the task
prompt. This lets you reach the underlying CLI's flag surface (model selection,
search/web access, effort levels, sandbox/policy switches, etc.) without the
daemon needing to hard-code every flag.

This is intentionally a passthrough, not a fixed table. Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, and Cursor rev their flag lists between releases. Before adding new
options, run the installed CLI's `--help` in `bash` to discover what it supports
today. Anything here is illustrative, not authoritative.

```jsonc
// Interactive Claude backend
{
  "action": "emanate",
  "backend": "claude",
  "tasks": [{
    "task": "Refactor auth.py for clarity.",
    "tools": [],
    "backend_options": {
      "model": "claude-opus-4-7"
    }
  }]
}

// Print-mode Claude backend
{
  "action": "emanate",
  "backend": "claude-p",
  "tasks": [{
    "task": "Review this PR and summarize risks.",
    "tools": [],
    "backend_options": {
      "model": "claude-opus-4-7"
    }
  }]
}

// Codex with model + web search
{
  "action": "emanate",
  "backend": "codex",
  "tasks": [{
    "task": "Find the breaking change in the last release.",
    "tools": [],
    "backend_options": {
      "model": "gpt-5",
      "search": true
    }
  }]
}
```

**Conversion rules** (validated before any process is spawned — a single bad
spec refuses the whole batch with a clear `ValueError`):

| Value type | Result |
|---|---|
| `true` | flag only, e.g. `{"search": true}` → `--search` |
| `false` / `null` | flag omitted entirely |
| string / int / float | `--flag <value>` |
| list of scalars | repeated: `--flag v1 --flag v2 ...` |
| nested object / array of objects | **rejected** with `ValueError` |

**Key safety:** keys must look like CLI flag names (letters/digits with `-` or
`_` separators, no leading `-`, no spaces). Underscores in keys are converted to
dashes in the emitted flag, so JSON-friendly `{"approval_policy":"never"}`
becomes `--approval-policy never`. Unsafe keys are rejected before any subprocess
call.

**Claude reserved flags:** Claude daemon backends own their execution mode.
`backend_options` cannot override harness-owned flags such as `--settings`,
`--print`, or `--output-format`; attempts are rejected before spawn. For example,
interactive `claude` must keep LingTai's inline hook settings, and `claude-p`
must keep stream-json output so daemon progress/result extraction remains
reliable.

**When it applies:** `backend_options` is honored only at `emanate` time (when
the CLI session is first spawned). `daemon(action="ask", ...)` reuses the
existing session via `claude --resume` / `codex exec resume` / backend-specific
resume and does not re-pass `backend_options` — the runtime flags chosen at
emanate time persist for the life of the session.

**Where it shows up on disk:** resolved options are written into the emanation's
`daemon.json` (`backend_options` field for the raw object, `backend_argv` for the
converted argv tokens), plus a `daemon_backend_options` entry in the parent's
`logs/events.jsonl`. A later `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")` and the events
log together let you reconstruct exactly which flags were passed.

`lingtai` backend ignores `backend_options`: there is no CLI process to forward
it to.

## Progress, resume, and `ask`

**Working directory:** CLI backends run in the parent agent's working directory
(`_working_dir`), not in the emanation's `daemons/em-N-*/` folder. The
`daemons/` folder tracks state (`daemon.json`, logs) and terminal output
(`result.txt`).

**Progress delivery:** CLI stdout/stderr and parsed transcript events are
persisted to the run directory as `cli_output` events and
`daemon.json.last_output`; they are not injected into the parent as ordinary
`[daemon:em-N]` request text. Completion/failure publishes one compact system
notification.

**`ask` on CLI backends is asynchronous.** For resumable CLI emanations,
`daemon(action="ask", id="em-N", message="...")` spawns/resumes the backend and
returns immediately with `{"status":"sent","async":true}`. Progress streams
into the same run directory (`cli_output` events, `last_output`); the final reply
text arrives as a `follow-up completed` system notification and is also visible
via `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")`. Poll `check` (or wait for the
notification) instead of expecting the reply in the `ask` return value.

While one CLI `ask` is in flight against a given emanation, a second `ask` to the
same id returns `{"status":"busy", ...}`. CLI sessions serialize per session, so
wait for the first follow-up to complete before sending another. The `lingtai`
backend's `ask` is unchanged: it buffers into a per-emanation followup buffer and
is drained by the in-process run loop.

## Backend-specific observability

**Interactive Claude (`claude`).** The daemon writes extra fields to
`daemon.json`:

- `claude_session_id`: captured from hook payloads or transcript rows.
- `claude_interactive_transcript_path`: Claude's transcript JSONL path from the
  `Stop` hook.
- `claude_interactive_raw_pty_log`: raw ANSI PTY log for debugging terminal
  startup/hangs.
- `claude_interactive_prompt_sent`: set once the daemon pasted the task after
  `SessionStart`.

If the backend appears to be waiting for login/trust/onboarding, LingTai records
a stderr warning and fails/terminates rather than auto-accepting prompts or
handling credentials.

**Print-mode Claude (`claude-p` / `claude-code`).** `claude_session_id` is set on
the first stream-json event that carries a session id (typically the system
`init` event, within milliseconds of process start). Earlier versions wrote the
session id only post-hoc by scanning `~/.claude/projects/`; that scan remains a
fallback if the stream never carries a session id.

**Codex.** `codex_session_id` (stored as `daemon.json.codex_session_id`) is set
on the first event — `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"<uuid>"}` — within
milliseconds of process start. `ask` runs `codex exec resume <codex_session_id>
--json "<message>"` asynchronously.

**Token accounting:** external CLI token/spend fields are deliberately not mixed
into the parent/kernel token ledger. They use separate billing paths and cache
semantics. Spend/progress remains visible through daemon run artifacts.
