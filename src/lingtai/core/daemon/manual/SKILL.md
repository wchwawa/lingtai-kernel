  Operational guide for the `daemon` tool — how to inspect, debug, and reason
  about emanations (the agent fragments you spawn for parallel sub-tasks).

  Reach for this manual when:
    - You called `daemon(action="emanate", ...)` and the emanation has been
      running long enough that you want to know if it's stuck, slow, or
      working — without killing it on a hunch.
    - An emanation finished with `state=failed` or `state=timeout` and you
      need to figure out why.
    - You want to inspect on-disk artifacts of a past emanation (chat
      transcript, token spend, event log) — the folders persist forever and
      `daemon(action="list")` only shows currently-active runs.
    - You're trying to understand why your token totals don't match the sum
      of what your tools claim — daemon spend is tagged into your parent
      ledger and may explain the gap.

  This manual covers: the on-disk folder layout under `daemons/em-N-*/`,
  exactly which fields in `daemon.json` answer "is it stuck?" vs "is it
  thinking?", how to tail `chat_history.jsonl` to see latest progress,
  where token attribution lives, how `reclaim` interacts with persistence,
  and a worked example of inspecting a 5-minute-running emanation.

  Does NOT cover: the daemon tool's argument schema (in the tool description
  itself) or the cross-process recovery / orphan-detection mechanics
  (those need separate spec work).

  Companion: `lingtai-kernel-anatomy reference/runtime-loop.md` covers the broader
  agent runtime that emanations are mini-versions of. Read that first if
  you don't yet understand the turn loop, then come here for daemon-specific
  inspection patterns.

# daemon manual

The `daemon` tool's schema description covers the happy path. This manual is the deeper reference: how to inspect a slow or failed emanation, the on-disk artifact layout, and worked examples.

## Each emanation is a forensic mini-avatar

Every time you call `daemon(action="emanate", tasks=[...])`, each task gets a working folder under `daemons/` in your own directory. The folder is named:

    daemons/em-<N>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<6 hex>/

where `em-<N>` is the in-context handle (e.g. `em-3`). The handle resets to `em-1` after `reclaim`, but the timestamp+hash means historical folders never collide. **Folders persist forever** — `reclaim` only stops processes, not files. They're cleaned up incidentally when you molt (which wipes the working directory).

This means: when an emanation looks stuck, you can read its actual state instead of guessing. Don't kill it on a hunch — inspect first.

## Folder layout

## Inspection patterns

### "Is this emanation actually doing anything?"

Read `daemon.json` once. The fields you want:

- `state` — `running` / `done` / `failed` / `cancelled` / `timeout`
- `current_tool` — `"read"` / `"bash"` / null. If null while `state=running`, the emanation is waiting on the LLM. If non-null, it's executing that tool.
- `turn` — which LLM round the emanation is on
- `tool_call_count` — how many tool dispatches it has done
- `tokens` — running totals (lingtai backend only; stays at 0 for `claude-code` and `codex` backends — see "CLI backends" below)
- `last_output` / `last_output_at` — recent stdout/stderr from CLI backends
- `result_preview` / `result_path` — bounded terminal preview and full `result.txt` path after completion
- `elapsed_s` — wall clock since start

If `current_tool` is null AND `tool_call_count` hasn't changed for a while, the LLM is thinking — wait. If `current_tool` is set and stays set, that tool is slow (e.g., a big file read or a long bash command).

### "What has it figured out so far?"

Tail `history/chat_history.jsonl`. Each line is one role/turn entry:

- `{role: "user", kind: "task"}` — the original task
- `{role: "assistant", text: "..."}` — what the emanation said
- `{role: "user", kind: "tool_results"}` — what the tools returned
- `{role: "user", kind: "followup"}` — your `daemon(action="ask", ...)` messages

Read the most recent assistant text to see the latest progress narrative.

### "What did it spend?"

Either of:
- `daemon.json` field `tokens` — running totals across the whole run
- `logs/token_ledger.jsonl` — per-call entries, sortable by line

The same per-call entries are also in your own `logs/token_ledger.jsonl` (the parent's), tagged with `source: "daemon"` and `em_id`. Your lifetime token totals (what `sum_token_ledger` reports) include all daemon spend.

### "Why did it fail?"

Read `daemon.json`'s `error` field — `{type, message}`. For more depth, tail `logs/events.jsonl` for the `daemon_error` event and look at the preceding `tool_call`/`tool_result` entries to see what was happening just before the failure.

## Polling cadence — when, how often, and which call

**First principle: completion is push-notified, not polled.** When an emanation reaches a terminal state (`done`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `timeout`), the kernel publishes a compact entry to `.notification/system.json` naming the em-id and pointing at `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")`. You do **not** need to poll to discover completion. If you find yourself running `check` repeatedly waiting for a `state` transition, stop — you're duplicating work the kernel is already doing.

You *do* need to poll when:

- You suspect an emanation is **stuck** (long elapsed wall-clock, no recent activity signals).
- You need a **mid-flight progress update** for your own planning (e.g., before dispatching a second emanation that depends on the first's partial finding).
- A CLI-backend emanation has been silent and you want to read `last_output` to gauge progress.

### Cadence decision tree

Use `elapsed_s` (from `daemon.json` or `list`) to pick an interval. These are starting points, not laws — adjust for task type and your own expected duration.

| `elapsed_s` | Default interval between checks | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 60 s | **Don't check.** Trust the dispatch; do other work. | Emanations almost never hang in the first minute. Polling here is pure noise. |
| 60 – 300 s | If you genuinely need progress, **one check** around 120 s, then back off. | Most one-shot tasks (file scan, focused research) finish in this band. |
| 300 – 900 s | Check at most every **2–3 minutes**. | Long synthesis or multi-file work. Notification will fire on completion. |
| 900 s + | Check every **5 minutes** *only* if you suspect a stall; otherwise wait for the notification. | If you've gone 15+ minutes with no `last_output` change AND `current_tool=null` AND `tool_call_count` unchanged across two consecutive checks → apply the stall heuristic below. |

**Never poll at sub-30-second intervals.** Each `check` returns up to `last` events plus a `daemon.json` snapshot; under 30 s of activity you'll see at most one new event, and the call costs tokens in both the request and the result. If you want a tighter loop, the task is probably wrong for an emanation — run it inline.

### Which call to use, in order

1. **`daemon(action="list")` first** when multiple emanations are in flight and you want a status sweep. Cheap; one line per emanation with `elapsed_s` and `state`. Use it to decide *which* (if any) to investigate.
2. **`daemon(action="check", id="em-N", last=20, truncate=500)`** when one emanation looks suspicious. `last=20` covers ~10 tool dispatches; bump to `last=50` for wider history. Keep `truncate=500` unless you specifically need full tool I/O.
3. **Direct `Read` of `daemon.json`** — only when you need a field `check` doesn't surface (rare). Prefer `check`.
4. **`tail` of `history/chat_history.jsonl`** — when `check` events don't tell you what the LLM is *thinking*. The last assistant text shows the current line of reasoning. (lingtai backend only — CLI backends don't write the LLM transcript here.)

### Stall heuristic (before you `reclaim`)

Before reclaiming, confirm **all** of:

- `state == "running"` and `elapsed_s` exceeds ~2× what you'd reasonably expect for the task.
- `current_tool` is the same value (or `null`) across two `check` calls ≥ 3 minutes apart.
- `tool_call_count` is unchanged across those two checks.
- For CLI backends: `last_output_at` is older than 5 minutes.
- For lingtai backend: no new entries in `chat_history.jsonl` between the two checks.

If any of those is false, the emanation is making progress — wait. Reclaim is destructive: the work in flight is gone (folders persist but the process is killed).

### Backend-specific polling notes

**`lingtai` backend (default).** Rich introspection: `current_tool`, `turn`, `tool_call_count`, `tokens`, and `chat_history.jsonl` all update in real time. Lean on these. You almost never need to look more often than once every 2–3 minutes.

**`claude-code` and `codex` backends.** `turn` is not incremented, `tokens` stays at 0, and the LLM transcript is not in `chat_history.jsonl` (it lives in the external CLI's own session store). Your live signals are:

- `last_output` / `last_output_at` in `daemon.json` — updates per assistant turn for `claude-code`, per `item.completed` for `codex`.
- `current_tool` — tracks the CLI's own tool calls (set on `tool_use` / cleared on `tool_result`).
- `logs/events.jsonl` `cli_output` entries — stdout/stderr stream.

Because the only progress signal is `last_output_at`, the right cadence on CLI backends is **"compare `last_output_at` to `now()`"** rather than a fixed interval: if it advanced since your last look, the emanation is alive; if it hasn't advanced in 5+ minutes AND `current_tool` is unchanged, apply the stall heuristic. Don't confuse a slow tool (large bash, big file read) with a stall — check `current_tool` first.

### Anti-patterns

- **Poll-for-completion loops.** Wrong because completion is pushed. A `while state == "running": sleep` pattern is working against the system — do other work or yield; the notification will tell you when there's something to inspect.
- **`check` immediately after `emanate`.** The first 30 seconds are almost always model warmup + initial tool calls; nothing actionable. Save the call.
- **Reclaiming on a hunch.** See the stall heuristic. Default to "let it cook."
- **`check` with `last=1000, truncate=0`.** Dumps the full event log into your context. Use targeted `last=20` and only widen if needed.


### Resting while daemon work is pending: set a cron notification reminder

If the daemon is healthy but unfinished and you are about to rest, do **not** keep polling and do **not** rely on memory. Set a lightweight wakeup reminder through the `bash-manual` section **"One-shot wakeup reminders via `.notification/cron.json`"**.

Use this when:

- a Claude Code / Codex backend task is still running but has enough context to finish alone;
- you opened a PR and want to check CI/mergeability later;
- a render/download/build/test run is expected to complete after you sleep;
- the human asked for a later follow-up and the reminder is for you, not for them.

The reminder should say what is pending and what to check, for example:

```text
⏺ Codex active. Plot regenerated (362KB, 23:38) — waiting for caption + commit. Polling at 23:42.
```

When the `cron` notification wakes you, read pad first, inspect the relevant daemon/job/PR, act, then dismiss the channel with `system(action="dismiss", channel="cron")`.

This complements the polling rule above: completion is push-notified, stalls are inspected sparingly, and deliberate rest gets one future reminder rather than a busy loop.

## Worked example: a daemon that's been running 5 minutes

You called `daemon(action="emanate", ...)` for `em-3`, asked it to "scan src/ for security issues", and it's been running 5 minutes. You're nervous.

```bash
# What's the live state?
read("daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/daemon.json")
# → state=running, turn=8, current_tool=null, tool_call_count=15, tokens.input=22000

# Last few lines of the transcript
bash("tail -n 20 daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/history/chat_history.jsonl")
# → assistant: "Found a potential SQL injection in db.py:42. Continuing..."

# Recent tool activity
bash("tail -n 10 daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/logs/events.jsonl")
# → series of read/grep events on src/db/, src/auth/
```

That's a healthy pattern: the LLM is between tool calls, has good progress narrative, and is steadily working through files. **Don't reclaim.** Let it cook.

## API note: `daemon(action="list")`

`list` reports only currently-active emanations (in-memory registry). It includes `run_id` and `path` so you know where to read on disk. Historical (completed/failed/cancelled) emanations don't appear in `list` — find them with `bash("ls daemons/")` instead.

## CLI backends

The `backend` parameter selects the execution engine for emanations. Default is `lingtai` (the built-in ChatSession loop). Two external CLI backends are also available:

| Backend | CLI command | Session resume | Notes |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------|
| `lingtai` | (built-in) | N/A — in-process `ask` | Default. Uses preset resolution, tool surface curation, model routing. |
| `claude-code` | `claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose --name <em_id> <task>` | `claude --resume <claude_session_id>` via `ask` (async — returns immediately, reply arrives via notification / `check`) | Session ID captured from the first event of the stream-json output (typically within ms of process start), so `ask` is usable as soon as `emanate` returns — even while the initial task is still running. |
| `codex` | `codex exec --json --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox <task>` | `codex exec resume <codex_session_id>` via `ask` (async — returns immediately, reply arrives via notification / `check`) | Mirrors claude-code. `thread.started` event carries the session id (codex internally calls it `thread_id`), captured immediately. `ask` resumes the same conversation context. |

**When to use CLI backends:** When the task benefits from a different agent runtime's tool surface (e.g., Claude Code's built-in file editing, Codex's sandboxed execution) rather than the lingtai emanation's curated tool set.

**CLI backends skip preset resolution** — the external CLI manages its own model, tools, and permissions. The `tools` field in the task spec is ignored for CLI backends.

### Passing free-form CLI flags via `backend_options`

For `claude-code` and `codex` backends, each task may carry an optional
`backend_options` JSON object that is converted to argv tokens and appended
to the CLI command before the task prompt. This lets you reach the underlying
CLI's full flag surface (model selection, search/web access, effort levels,
sandbox/policy switches, etc.) without the daemon needing to hard-code them.

**This is intentionally a passthrough, not a fixed table.** Claude Code and
Codex both rev their flag lists between releases. **Before adding new
options, run `claude --help` or `codex exec --help` in `bash` to discover
what the installed version actually supports today.** Anything in this
manual is illustrative, not authoritative.

```jsonc
// Claude Code with a specific reasoning effort and model
{
  "action": "emanate",
  "backend": "claude-code",
  "tasks": [{
    "task": "Refactor auth.py for clarity.",
    "tools": [],
    "backend_options": {
      "effort": "high",
      "model": "claude-opus-4-7"
    }
  }]
}

// Codex with model + web search
{
  "action": "emanate",
  "backend": "codex",
  "tasks": [{
    "task": "Find the breaking change in the last release.",
    "tools": [],
    "backend_options": {
      "model": "gpt-5",
      "search": true
    }
  }]
}
```

**Conversion rules** (validated before any process is spawned — a single
bad spec refuses the whole batch with a clear `ValueError`):

| Value type | Result |
|---|---|
| `true` | flag only, e.g. `{"search": true}` → `--search` |
| `false` / `null` | flag omitted entirely |
| string / int / float | `--flag <value>` |
| list of scalars | repeated: `--flag v1 --flag v2 ...` |
| nested object / array of objects | **rejected** with `ValueError` |

**Key safety:** keys must look like CLI flag names (letters/digits with
`-` or `_` separators, no leading `-`, no spaces). Underscores in keys are
converted to dashes in the emitted flag, so JSON-friendly `{"output_format":
"json"}` becomes `--output-format json`. Unsafe keys are rejected before
any subprocess call.

**When it applies:** `backend_options` is honored only at `emanate` time
(when the CLI session is first spawned). `daemon(action="ask", ...)` reuses
the existing session via `claude --resume` / `codex exec resume` and does
not re-pass `backend_options` — the runtime flags chosen at emanate time
persist for the life of the session.

**Where it shows up on disk:** the resolved options are written into the
emanation's `daemon.json` (`backend_options` field for the raw object,
`backend_argv` for the converted argv tokens), plus a
`daemon_backend_options` entry in the parent's `logs/events.jsonl`. So a
later `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")` and the events log together let
you reconstruct exactly which flags were passed.

**`lingtai` backend ignores `backend_options`.** The field is silently
dropped for the built-in backend — there's no CLI process to forward it to.

**Working directory:** Both CLI backends run in the parent agent's working directory (`_working_dir`), not in the emanation's `daemons/em-N-*/` folder. The `daemons/` folder is used for tracking state (`daemon.json`, logs) and terminal output (`result.txt`).

**Progress delivery:** CLI stdout/stderr is persisted to the run directory as `cli_output` events and `daemon.json.last_output`; it is not injected into the parent as ordinary `[daemon:em-N]` request text. Completion/failure publishes one compact `system` notification telling the parent which daemon finished and to inspect it with `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")`.

**`ask` on CLI backends is asynchronous.** For `claude-code` and `codex` emanations, `daemon(action="ask", id="em-N", message="...")` spawns the resumed CLI subprocess and returns immediately with `{"status":"sent","async":true}` — it does **not** wait for the reply. Progress streams into the same run directory (`cli_output` events, `last_output`); the final reply text arrives as a `follow-up completed` system notification and is also visible via `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")`. Poll `check` (or wait for the notification) instead of expecting the reply in the `ask` return value.

While one CLI `ask` is in flight against a given emanation, a second `ask` to the same id returns `{"status":"busy", ...}` — `claude --resume` and `codex exec resume` serialize per session, so wait for the first follow-up to complete (or check the notification) before sending another. The `lingtai` backend's `ask` is unchanged: it buffers into a per-emanation followup buffer and is drained by the in-process run loop.

**Claude Code backend specifics.** The backend streams structured JSON events from Claude Code in real time (`--output-format stream-json --verbose`):

- `daemon(check)` sees live progress as each assistant turn arrives — `last_output` updates per turn and `current_tool` tracks Claude Code's own tool calls (`set` on `tool_use` blocks, `clear` on the matching `tool_result`). Note that `tokens` stays at 0 — Claude Code runs through its own provider account and we deliberately don't merge its `usage` fields into the kernel's token ledger (they'd mix with native LLM-adapter accounting that has different cache semantics). Spend is visible to the human via Claude Code's own UI and the `cli_output` event stream.
- `claude_session_id` is set on the first event that carries a session id (typically the system `init` event, within ms of process start). This means `daemon(action="ask", id="em-N", message="...")` works the moment `emanate` returns — you don't have to wait for the initial task to complete. (Earlier versions wrote the session id only post-hoc by scanning `~/.claude/projects/`; that scan is now a fallback for the unusual case where the stream never carried a session id.)
- stderr is captured to its own pipe (no longer merged into stdout) and persisted as `cli_output` events with `stream="stderr"`, so API errors, auth failures, and rate limits are visible during the run rather than buried in a buffered stdout.
- `turn` is not incremented for CLI backends — Claude Code runs its own LLM loop and we don't see "turns" in the same sense. Use `last_output` and `cli_output` events to gauge progress.
- An `is_error=true` in the final `result` event is surfaced as a failed emanation even when the underlying process exited 0, so an error reported inside the LLM stream doesn't masquerade as success.

**Codex backend specifics.** Identical observability + resumability story as claude-code, with codex's own event vocabulary (`--json`):

- `daemon(check)` sees live progress: `last_output` updates as each `item.completed` event with `type=agent_message` arrives. Note that `tokens` stays at 0 — codex runs through its own provider account, and its `cached_input_tokens` semantics differ from the kernel's LLM adapters (codex's `input_tokens` already includes the cached portion, anthropic's doesn't), so we deliberately don't merge codex's `usage` into the token ledger. Spend is visible via the codex CLI's own output and the `cli_output` event stream.
- `codex_session_id` (stored as `daemon.json.codex_session_id`) is set on the first event — `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"<uuid>"}` — within ms of process start. `daemon(action="ask", id="em-N", message="...")` runs `codex exec resume <codex_session_id> --json "<message>"` asynchronously: the call returns immediately and the resumed turn's reply lands in the run_dir (`last_output`, `cli_output` events) plus a `follow-up completed` notification, same as the claude-code ask path.
- stderr is captured to its own pipe (was: merged into stdout via `--ephemeral` mode) and persisted as `cli_output` events with `stream="stderr"`.
- Codex doesn't emit an `is_error` flag like Claude Code; the kernel treats absence of a `turn.completed` event (combined with no captured `agent_message` items) as failure even when the process exits 0.
- `--ephemeral` is intentionally NOT passed: it would disable session persistence and break `daemon(ask)`. Sessions persist under `~/.codex/sessions/` and can be re-resumed by ID for the lifetime of the session record.

### Codex modal capabilities and native image generation

`backend="codex"` delegates to the external Codex CLI/runtime, so the emanation can use whatever native tools the installed Codex account/profile exposes — including modalities that aren't surfaced in `codex --help`. The `--image` flag there only documents image *input*; native image *generation* (and other modal tools) may still be available at runtime depending on the profile.

When asking a Codex emanation to generate images, be explicit:

- Request **PNG or JPEG** outputs (say "not SVG" unless you actually want vector art — Codex will otherwise often fall back to an inline SVG).
- Name an **explicit writable directory** under the parent working dir (e.g. `media/images/`) and have the emanation write files there with stable names.
- Specify **dimensions, number of variants, and style** up front; Codex won't ask.

After the emanation completes, verify:

1. `daemon(action="check", id="em-N")` — confirm `state=done` and scan `cli_output` for file paths Codex reported writing.
2. Inspect the output directory directly (e.g. `ls media/images/`) and confirm the files are real PNG/JPEG bytes, not 0-byte stubs or an SVG.

**Detection / failure honesty.** If Codex reports that image generation is unavailable, refuses the modality, or completes without producing any image files, treat it as **runtime/profile unsupported** and report that honestly to the human. Do **not** silently fall back to the MiniMax `draw` capability or accept an SVG as a substitute — the human asked for a Codex-native PNG/JPEG and a different result needs their decision, not yours.

## What the manual does NOT cover

- Provider routing / LLM presets — deferred to a separate spec.
- Cross-process recovery — if your kernel restarted mid-daemon, the folder may show `state=running` indefinitely. Compare `now()` vs `.heartbeat` mtime to detect orphans.
- Folder cleanup — there is none. Molts wipe the working dir. For non-molting agents, you may eventually want to `rm -rf daemons/em-*-2026-04-*` manually.

## Cleanup / Footprint

Daemon runs are intentionally persistent forensic records. Each emanation leaves
`daemons/em-*` under the parent agent, including `daemon.json`, events,
transcript/history, result files, and token ledgers. Do not delete an active
run, and do not delete a run you still need for a report, review, or cost audit.

Footprint check (read-only, records the audit):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, time
from pathlib import Path
agent = Path.cwd()
daemons = agent / "daemons"
items = [p for p in daemons.glob("em-*") if p.is_dir()] if daemons.is_dir() else []
def size(p):
    return sum(f.stat().st_size for f in p.rglob("*") if f.is_file())
rows = [(p, size(p)) for p in items]
total = sum(s for _, s in rows)
print(f"daemon runs: {len(rows)}; bytes: {total}")
for p, s in sorted(rows, key=lambda r: r[1], reverse=True)[:20]:
    print(f"{s:>12}  {p}")
log = agent / "logs" / "cleanup.jsonl"; log.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
log.open("a", encoding="utf-8").write(json.dumps({"ts": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", time.gmtime()), "tool": "daemon", "dry_run": True, "candidates": len(rows), "bytes": total, "human_approved": False, "summary": "daemon footprint audit"}) + "\n")
PY
```

Recommended cadence: after daemon-heavy debugging sessions, before molt if a
large review generated many runs, and monthly for always-on orchestrators.
Cleanup is optional. Before deleting old completed `daemons/em-*` folders, show
the dry-run output to the user and get explicit consent; then append an `apply`
record to `logs/cleanup.jsonl` with the deleted paths/bytes.
