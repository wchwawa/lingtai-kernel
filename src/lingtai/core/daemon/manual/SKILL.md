# Daemon Manual — Router

The `daemon` tool schema covers dispatch/follow-up/check/reclaim. This manual
routes to deeper operational references: how to inspect daemon artifacts, decide
whether work is stuck, use CLI backends safely, and clean up old emanations.

Scope note: this manual does **not** restate the daemon tool argument schema, and
it does not document cross-process recovery/orphan-detection internals. For the
broader runtime turn loop that daemon emanations mirror, use `lingtai-kernel-anatomy`
and its runtime-loop reference.

Use the smallest reference that matches the problem. Do not kill or reclaim a
daemon on a hunch; inspect first.

## Nested reference catalog

`daemon-manual` owns these nested references. They are parent-owned drill-down
files, not standalone top-level skills.

```yaml
- name: daemon-forensics
  location: reference/forensics/SKILL.md
  description: |
    Daemon artifact forensics: persistent daemons/em-* folders, daemon.json
    status fields, chat_history.jsonl, token_ledger.jsonl, events.jsonl, and how
    to inspect progress without guessing.
- name: daemon-inspection
  location: reference/inspection/SKILL.md
  description: |
    Polling cadence, stall heuristics, anti-patterns, backend-specific polling
    notes, and reminders before resting while daemon work remains pending.
- name: daemon-cli-backends
  location: reference/cli-backends/SKILL.md
  description: |
    Daemon API details and CLI backends: daemon(action=list), claude-code/codex/
    opencode behavior, backend_options flag passing, preset/capability
    inheritance, and Codex modal capabilities.
- name: daemon-cleanup
  location: reference/cleanup/SKILL.md
  description: |
    Scope boundaries and daemon footprint cleanup: what the manual does not
    cover, reclaim persistence, and safe cleanup of old daemon artifacts.
```

## Router table

| Need / keywords | Read |
|---|---|
| Find an emanation's folder; inspect `daemon.json`, transcript, token ledger, event log; understand result paths or token attribution | `reference/forensics/SKILL.md` |
| Decide whether a daemon is stuck; choose when to list/check/tail; avoid polling too often; set a reminder before resting | `reference/inspection/SKILL.md` |
| Use `daemon(action="list")`; choose `lingtai` vs `claude-code`/`codex`/`opencode`; pass `backend_options`; understand CLI backend limitations | `reference/cli-backends/SKILL.md` |
| Retire or audit old daemon artifacts; understand what `reclaim` does and does not delete; scope boundaries | `reference/cleanup/SKILL.md` |

## Quick decision tree

1. **Need only the daemon tool argument schema?** Use the tool description.
2. **Daemon seems slow?** Read `reference/forensics/SKILL.md`, then
   `reference/inspection/SKILL.md` if you might intervene.
3. **Daemon failed/timed out?** Read recent events/transcript via the forensics
   reference before retrying.
4. **Choosing an execution backend or flags?** Read
   `reference/cli-backends/SKILL.md`.
5. **Cleaning old folders?** Read `reference/cleanup/SKILL.md` and avoid deleting
   useful forensic evidence without a reason.

## Core rules to keep resident

- Each emanation is disposable memory but durable evidence: its folder persists
  after completion or reclaim until cleanup.
- `daemon(action="list")` is a status overview, not a full transcript.
- Completion is push-notified; do not poll only to ask "is it done yet".
- If repeated-call `_advisory` appears on `daemon(list/check)`, the call still
  ran; treat it as a signal to stop the loop, centralize status checking in the
  parent, and read `reference/inspection/SKILL.md` before polling again.
- If an emanation might be stuck, inspect state changes, recent transcript, and
  event activity before reclaiming.
- CLI backend flags are passthroughs. Verify the current CLI's `--help` before
  relying on a flag.

## Maintenance

Keep this router short. Put new backend recipes, inspection examples, and cleanup
procedures in nested references so agents load only the needed detail.
