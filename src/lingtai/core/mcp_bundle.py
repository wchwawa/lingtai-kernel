"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``mcp`` tool through the SDK tool-config
bundle declaration (stage 3F).

The tool-config/catalog counterpart of ``lingtai.core.communication_bundle`` (the
high-state ``email`` / ``daemon`` bridge, stage 3D), ``lingtai.core.system_bundle``
(the lifecycle bridge, stage 3C), and ``lingtai.core.file_bundle`` (the file-tool
bridge, stages 3A/3B). The SDK module :mod:`lingtai_sdk.mcp_tools` *declares* the
``mcp`` registry-view surface as a
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` and offers a host injection
seam, but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must not import the wrapper,
and the kernel must never import the SDK) — it ships **no real handler**. This
module is where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK and the wrapper
capability, injects the genuine handler and so proves the tool-config
bundle-execution pattern end to end against actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
``mcp`` is a **wrapper capability** (like ``daemon`` and the file tools), not a
built-in tool. Its real handler is the closure ``lingtai.core.mcp.make_handler
(agent)`` builds — the *same* closure ``mcp.setup()`` registers via
``agent.add_tool`` (single source of truth; see ``lingtai.core.mcp.make_handler``).
The bridge reuses that *same* factory — there is no second implementation. The
bundle-hosted ``mcp`` tool runs byte-identical logic to the tool ``setup()``
registers, against the same ``agent._working_dir`` and the same ``_reconcile``
(read registry → re-render the ``mcp`` system-prompt section → health snapshot)
semantics. The bridge lives in the wrapper — not the kernel/SDK — because the
dependency direction is one-way: the wrapper *may* import the SDK
(``lingtai_sdk.mcp_tools``) and the wrapper capability; the **kernel/SDK must
never import the wrapper**. Putting the SDK import here (lazily, inside the bridge
functions) preserves that one-way ``wrapper -> sdk`` edge.

The SDK ``BundleHost`` invokes its handler with keyword args; the wrapper ``mcp``
handler takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny ``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the
two without changing either contract — the identical adapter the file / lifecycle
/ communication bridges use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the ``mcp``
tool — ``mcp.setup()`` remains the live path. It is an additive, observable seam:
a host (or a test) can drive the real ``mcp`` registry-view tool through the
declared manifest, the tool-config migration template later stages build on.
Constructing the bridge host writes nothing to the registry and starts no MCP
server — only an explicit ``host.invoke("mcp", action="show")`` re-reconciles,
exactly as the live path does. Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
