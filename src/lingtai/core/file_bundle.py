"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real file tools through the SDK bundle
declarations — read/glob/grep (stage 3A) and write/edit (stage 3B).

This is the wrapper half of the SDK file-tool bundle template. The SDK modules
*declare* the low-state file tools as
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` objects and offer host
injection seams, but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must not import
the wrapper, and the kernel must not import the SDK) — they ship **no real
handler**. This module is where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK, injects
the genuine file-tool handlers and so proves the bundle-execution pattern end to
end against the real behavior. Two SDK modules are bridged here:

* :mod:`lingtai_sdk.file_tools` — the **read-only / query** tools ``read`` /
  ``glob`` / ``grep`` (stage 3A); all ``SecurityDanger.SAFE``.
* :mod:`lingtai_sdk.file_mutation_tools` — the **side-effecting** tools
  ``write`` / ``edit`` (stage 3B); ``write`` is ``DESTRUCTIVE``, ``edit`` is
  ``CAUTION``.

The handlers are the *same* closures the normal capability path registers:
``lingtai.core.{read,glob,grep,write,edit}.make_handler(agent)``. There is no
second implementation — the bundle-hosted tool runs byte-identical logic to the
tool ``setup()`` registers on the agent, against the same ``agent._file_io`` /
``agent._working_dir`` and the same path-sandbox / traversal-budget / overwrite /
error semantics.

The wrapper handlers take a single ``args: dict``; the SDK
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capability_host.BundleHost.invoke` passes keyword args. The
tiny ``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the two without changing either contract.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the file
tools — ``setup()`` remains the live path. It is an additive, observable seam:
a host (or a test) can drive the real file tools through the declared manifest,
which is the migration template later stages build on. In particular, the
declared danger posture on the write/edit manifests is **not** enforced here:
this bridge only hosts and runs the real handler. Danger is a declaration the
stage-17 :mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge` reads — a separate, not-yet-installed
gate — so the side-effecting tools run here exactly as the read tools do.
Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
