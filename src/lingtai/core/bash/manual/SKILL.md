# Bash Manual — Router

The `bash` tool schema covers one-off command execution. This manual routes to
operational depth that is too long for the schema: host scheduling, mailbox-drop
wakeups, reminder files, debugging, and cleanup.

For ordinary short, deterministic one-off shell commands, use the tool schema
synchronously. For anything involving time, recurring work, external schedulers,
a silent scheduled job, or a **long-running agent/coding CLI** (see the resident
rule below), start here.

## Quick decision tree

1. **Short deterministic host work** (finishes in seconds: `ls`, `git status`,
   `grep`, a quick build)? Use `bash` synchronously; this manual is not needed
   unless the command is risky, scheduled, or failing mysteriously.
2. **Long-running agent/coding CLI** (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, `opencode run`,
   Cursor Agent, MiMo Code, Qwen Code, Oh-My-Pi, Gemini CLI, Aider, Goose,
   OpenHands, Crush, or any sub-agent that may think/run tools for minutes)?
   **Never run it synchronously.** Use `bash(async=true)` and poll — see the
   resident rule below.
3. **Time itself is the trigger?** Read `reference/scheduled-work/SKILL.md`.
4. **You only need a single future nudge?** Read
   `reference/notification-reminders/SKILL.md`.
5. **A scheduled job already exists and is misbehaving?** Read
   `reference/debugging-cleanup/SKILL.md` before editing blindly.

## Core rules to keep resident

- **Synchronous `bash` is only for short, deterministic commands.** A long-running
  agent/coding CLI session — `claude -p`, `codex exec`, `opencode run`, the Cursor
  agent CLI, or any sub-agent that may think and run tools for minutes — must
  **never** be a synchronous `bash` call. Run it with `bash(async=true)` and poll
  the returned `job_id`. A synchronous call blocks the whole turn until the child
  exits: you stay `ACTIVE` and stop seeing channel notifications (mail, refresh,
  interrupts) for the entire duration. Async + poll keeps you responsive and
  prevents ACTIVE blockage while the child CLI works.

  ```text
  # Start the child agent in the background — returns immediately with a job_id:
  bash(async=true, command="claude -p 'refactor the auth module' --output-format json")
  # → {"status": "ok", "job_id": "ab12…", "pid": 4321}

  # Later turns: poll until done (handle mail/other work between polls):
  bash(action="poll", job_id="ab12…")
  # → {"status": "running", …}   then eventually
  # → {"status": "done", "exit_code": 0, "stdout": "…", "stderr": "…"}

  # Abandon it if needed:
  bash(action="cancel", job_id="ab12…")
  ```

- **If repeated-call `_advisory` appears on `bash(action="poll")`, stop
  tight polling.** The poll already executed; the advisory is not a block. If
  the job is still running and nothing meaningful changed, handle any human
  messages, do other work, or set one future reminder (`bash` notification
  reminder or internal delayed self-email) and yield/idle. Poll again only when
  a completion notification arrives, the reminder fires, or you have a concrete
  reason to expect new state.

- **Idle care: never hand a launched async job entirely to its completion
  notification.** Once you start a long-running agent/coding CLI with
  `bash(async=true)` (or any child sub-process), do not go fully IDLE relying
  only on the completion/IDLE signal. Before resting, arm **at least one**
  self-wake (a `.notification/cron.json` reminder or an internal delayed
  self-email). Pick the delay from the task's *expected* duration — not a fixed
  number; a 30 s scan and a 40 min build warrant different windows. When the
  wake fires, health-check rather than assume progress: confirm the log is
  **growing**, the PID/child is **alive**, the output file/worktree shows
  **progress**, and the job is not stuck on an interactive prompt or a
  provider/model error. If there is no progress, do not keep waiting — cancel,
  downgrade, or switch path, and report to the human. A job that exits
  immediately or sits silent past its expected window is the failure mode this
  rule exists to catch.

- LingTai has no built-in recurring scheduler. Host schedulers wake agents by
  producing channel input, usually a mailbox-drop or notification file.
- Prefer event watchers/webhooks when an external event is the real trigger;
  prefer cron/launchd/systemd only when time is the trigger or polling is truly
  the right tradeoff.
- Scheduler scripts must be idempotent, audited, logged, absolute-path based,
  and explicit about how they wake the agent.
- On macOS, remember launchd process-tree reaping; use the documented
  double-fork pattern when a child process must outlive the launchd job.
- Do not leave silent janitors or hidden recurring jobs behind. Document and
  clean them up when the human no longer needs them.

## Maintenance

Keep this top-level router short. Add detailed examples, platform recipes, and
troubleshooting trees to nested references so agents can load only the section
needed for the current task.
