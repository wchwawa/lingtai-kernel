# Knowledge capability contract

`knowledge` is the agent-private durable knowledge capability. It scans the
agent's local `knowledge/` directory for `KNOWLEDGE.md`-bearing entries and
injects a compact catalog into the system prompt. The implementation lives in
`src/lingtai/core/knowledge/`; the code is the source of truth.

## Routing Card

**Use this when:**
- You are editing the private durable knowledge capability.
- You are reviewing the catalog scanner, prompt injection, frontmatter schema,
  or the knowledge/skill boundary.
- You need to verify that knowledge entries can carry private references
  (local paths, mail ids, logs) without violating the skills contract.

**Do not use this for:**
- Skill catalog behavior: read `src/lingtai/core/skills/CONTRACT.md` (the
  structurally isomorphic, physically separate sibling).
- Code navigation only: read `src/lingtai/core/knowledge/ANATOMY.md`.
- Authoring procedures for sharing across agents: write a skill instead.

**Fast paths:** tool schema -> §Tool surface; on-disk layout -> §Storage;
how it differs from skills -> §Knowledge vs skills.

## Scope

- Canonical capability name: `knowledge`.
- Canonical tool name: `knowledge`.
- Former names `library` and `codex` are intentionally not compatibility aliases.

This is a breaking rename while the user base is still small. New manifests must
spell the private durable store as `knowledge`. Old `library`/`codex` capability
entries are skipped as unknown capabilities; old `library(...)`/`codex(...)`
tool calls are unavailable.

`knowledge` means private durable memory: what one agent has learned, decided,
and discovered. `skills` means portable procedure catalog. Knowledge entries
MAY reference public skills; skills MUST NOT depend on private knowledge entry
contents, agent-local paths, mail ids, or other private memory state.

## Knowledge vs skills

The two capabilities are structurally isomorphic but physically separate:

| Aspect | `skills` | `knowledge` |
|---|---|---|
| Root directory | `<agent>/.library/{intrinsic,custom}/` | `<agent>/knowledge/` |
| Manifest file | `SKILL.md` | `KNOWLEDGE.md` |
| Tool name | `skills` | `knowledge` |
| Tool surface | `info` | `info` |
| Prompt section | protected `skills` (YAML catalog) | protected `knowledge` (YAML catalog) |
| Extra path sources | `manifest.capabilities.skills.paths` | none — strictly per-agent |
| Visibility | portable / shareable | private / agent-owned |
| May reference local paths, mail ids, logs | no | yes |

Two separate handlers register two separate tools. The scanner and frontmatter
parser logic mirror each other but live in their own modules so each can evolve
independently without leaking private semantics into the public skill catalog.

## Tool surface

The schema requires `action` and accepts exactly one action:

| Action | Required fields | Optional fields | Return on success |
|---|---|---|---|
| `info` | — | — | `{status: "ok", knowledge_dir, catalog_size, problems}` |

Unknown actions return `{status: "error", message: ...}` and do not mutate
state. The previous JSON-database actions (`submit`, `view`, `consolidate`,
`delete`) are intentionally removed: knowledge is now authored by writing
`KNOWLEDGE.md` files with the regular `write`/`edit` tools, just like skills.
There is no in-tool capacity limit; the historical `knowledge_limit` kwarg is
accepted but ignored.

Only `knowledge(...)` is registered. There is no `library(...)` or `codex(...)`
alias.

## Storage

The on-disk layout is:

```text
<agent>/knowledge/
  <entry-1>/
    KNOWLEDGE.md
    scripts/
    assets/
    notes/
  <entry-2>/
    KNOWLEDGE.md
    raw-log.json
  ...
```

Each entry is a directory whose name is the routing handle. The directory must
contain a `KNOWLEDGE.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: <routing handle>
description: <one or more sentences; prompt-visible>
version: <optional>
---

<body — read on demand via the `read` tool>
```

Required frontmatter fields are `name` and `description`. Entries missing
either are skipped and surfaced in `problems`. Folders without a
`KNOWLEDGE.md` are recursed into so nested namespaces are allowed; folders
with loose files but no `KNOWLEDGE.md` are reported as corrupted.

Entries may carry supporting files (scripts, assets, notes, raw logs,
attachments). Those files are not parsed by the capability; the agent opens
them via the regular `read`/`bash` tools when it loads an entry.

The agent is the sole long-term author of `knowledge/`. The only capability
write is a one-time legacy migration: if `knowledge/knowledge.json` or old `codex/codex.json` exists, entries are converted to `knowledge/<slug>/KNOWLEDGE.md`, each legacy `supplementary` field is written to `references/supplementary.md`, and the source JSON is renamed to `<name>.json.migrated` to prevent repeat work.

## Prompt injection

On setup and on every `info` call, the capability rewrites protected prompt
section `knowledge`:

- If there are entries, the section contains a preamble plus a YAML
  catalog. Each entry is rendered as a `- name:` block with `location:`
  (absolute `KNOWLEDGE.md` path) and a `description:` block scalar.
- If there are no entries, the section is cleared.

Only `name`, `description`, and `path` are ever injected. Bodies and supporting
files stay out of the prompt until the agent loads them through `read`. This
mirrors the skills catalog and keeps the always-on prompt cheap.

## Knowledge / skill directionality

Knowledge entries MAY reference skills by public path/name when an agent has
learned that a skill is useful for a recurring situation.

Skills MUST NOT reference private knowledge entry paths, private agent paths,
mail ids, or agent-local memory state.

Reason: skills are portable shared procedures; knowledge is agent-local
accumulated memory. The dependency direction is knowledge -> skill, never
skill -> private knowledge.

## Anchored claims

| Claim | Source | Test |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge` is the only private durable memory capability in the builtin registry | `src/lingtai/core/registry.py` | `tests/test_check_caps.py::test_get_all_providers_includes_expected_capabilities` |
| `knowledge` setup registers only the `knowledge` tool | `src/lingtai/core/knowledge/__init__.py` | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_knowledge_setup_registers_only_knowledge_tool` |
| Legacy `knowledge/knowledge.json` and `codex/codex.json` entries migrate once into `KNOWLEDGE.md` folders; `supplementary` becomes `references/supplementary.md` | `src/lingtai/core/knowledge/__init__.py` | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_legacy_knowledge_json_migrates_to_knowledge_md`, `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_legacy_codex_json_migrates_to_knowledge_md` |
| Manager-style lookup is exact: `knowledge` resolves and former names do not | `src/lingtai/agent.py` | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_former_alias_capabilities_do_not_register_knowledge` |
| Catalog reads `<agent>/knowledge/<name>/KNOWLEDGE.md` and excludes `SKILL.md` entries | `src/lingtai/core/knowledge/__init__.py` | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_knowledge_md_convention_distinct_from_skill_md` |
| Prompt catalog includes only `name`/`description`/`path` from frontmatter | `src/lingtai/core/knowledge/__init__.py` | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_prompt_catalog_only_metadata_not_body` |
| Entries may carry references, scripts, and assets | filesystem convention | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_entries_may_have_scripts_and_assets` |

## Verification matrix

| Invariant | Automated test | Manual check | Risk if broken |
|---|---|---|---|
| `knowledge(...)` is the only private-memory tool | `tests/test_knowledge.py` | Boot with `capabilities={"knowledge": {}}` and inspect tools | Old names linger and confuse the model |
| Former `library`/`codex` names do not register | alias-removal tests in `tests/test_knowledge.py` / `tests/test_skills.py` | Boot old manifests and inspect capability skip logs | Breaking rename is only half-applied |
| Skills do not depend on private knowledge | documented invariant; enforce by review | Check shared skill docs for private paths/ids | Shared skills become non-portable |
| Knowledge and skills use distinct manifest filenames | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_knowledge_md_convention_distinct_from_skill_md` | Drop a `SKILL.md` into `<agent>/knowledge/foo/` and confirm it is not picked up | Physical separation collapses; private/public boundary blurs |
| Body content stays out of prompt catalog | `tests/test_knowledge.py::test_prompt_catalog_only_metadata_not_body` | Author an entry with a long body and inspect the prompt section | Prompt bloat / private detail leakage |
