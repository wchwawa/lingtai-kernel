"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``avatar_spawn`` / ``avatar_rules`` tools
through the SDK peer-spawn bundle declarations (stage 3I).

The independent-peer-spawning counterpart of ``lingtai.core.bash_bundle`` (the
``bash`` bridge, stage 3H), ``lingtai.core.communication_bundle`` (the ``email`` /
``daemon`` bridge, stage 3D), and the ``mcp`` / ``knowledge`` / ``skills`` bridges.
The SDK module :mod:`lingtai_sdk.avatar_tools` *declares* the ``avatar_spawn`` and
``avatar_rules`` surfaces as :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest`\\ s
and offers host injection seams, but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must
not import the wrapper, and the kernel must never import the SDK) — it ships **no
real handlers**. This module is where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK and
the wrapper capability, injects the genuine handlers and so proves the
bundle-execution pattern end to end against actual behavior.

Where the real handlers live — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
``avatar`` is a **wrapper capability** (like ``daemon``, ``mcp``, ``knowledge``,
``skills``, ``bash``, and the file tools), not a built-in tool. Its real
handlers are the ``handle_spawn`` / ``handle_rules`` methods of an
:class:`~lingtai.core.avatar.AvatarManager` built by
``lingtai.core.avatar.make_manager(agent)`` — the *same* manager
``avatar.setup()`` registers via ``agent.add_tool`` (single source of truth; see
``lingtai.core.avatar.make_manager`` / ``make_spawn_handler`` / ``make_rules_handler``).
The bridge reuses that *same* factory — there is no second implementation. The
bundle-hosted ``avatar_spawn`` / ``avatar_rules`` tools run byte-identical logic to
the tools ``setup()`` registers, against the same parent ``agent`` and the same
``agent._working_dir`` network root.

The bridge lives in the wrapper — not the kernel/SDK — because the dependency
direction is one-way: the wrapper *may* import the SDK
(``lingtai_sdk.avatar_tools``) and the wrapper capability; the **kernel/SDK must
never import the wrapper**. Putting the SDK import here (lazily, inside the bridge
functions) preserves that one-way ``wrapper -> sdk`` edge.

The SDK ``BundleHost`` invokes its handler with keyword args; the wrapper avatar
handlers take a single ``args: dict``. The tiny ``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the
two without changing either contract — the identical adapter the file / lifecycle /
communication / mcp / knowledge / skills / bash bridges use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the avatar
tools — ``avatar.setup()`` remains the live path. It is an additive, observable
seam: a host (or a test) can drive the real avatar tools through the declared
manifests. The declared danger posture (bundle-level ``destructive`` plus the
per-tool / per-args risk helpers) is **not** enforced here: this bridge only hosts
and runs the real handlers, and danger-based gating is the stage-17 guard bridge's
job, not installed here. Constructing the bridge hosts spawns no process and writes
no file — only an explicit ``host.invoke("avatar_spawn", name=...)`` (gated by the
live mission-quality gate, name validation, liveness check, and ``dry_run``
short-circuit) or ``host.invoke("avatar_rules", rules_content=...)`` (gated by the
live admin check) does. Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
