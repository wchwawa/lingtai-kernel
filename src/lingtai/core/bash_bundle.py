"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``bash`` tool through the SDK shell-execution
bundle declaration (stage 3H).

The arbitrary-shell-execution counterpart of ``lingtai.core.communication_bundle``
(the ``email`` / ``daemon`` bridge, stage 3D), ``lingtai.core.mcp_bundle`` (stage
3F), and ``lingtai.core.knowledge_bundle`` (stage 3G). The SDK module
:mod:`lingtai_sdk.bash_tools` *declares* the ``bash`` shell surface as a
:class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` and offers a host injection seam,
but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must not import the wrapper, and the
kernel must never import the SDK) — it ships **no real handler**. This module is
where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK and the wrapper capability, injects
the genuine handler and so proves the bundle-execution pattern end to end against
actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
``bash`` is a **wrapper capability** (like ``daemon``, ``mcp``, and the file
tools), not a built-in tool. Its real handler is the ``handle`` method of a
:class:`~lingtai.core.bash.BashManager` built by ``lingtai.core.bash.make_handler
(agent)`` — the *same* manager/handler ``bash.setup()`` registers via
``agent.add_tool`` (single source of truth; see ``lingtai.core.bash.make_manager``
/ ``make_handler``). The bridge reuses that *same* factory — there is no second
implementation. The bundle-hosted ``bash`` tool runs byte-identical logic to the
tool ``setup()`` registers, against the same ``agent._working_dir`` sandbox and the
same resolved :class:`~lingtai.core.bash.BashPolicy` (the bridge, like
``setup()``'s default, resolves the bundled default policy via
``bash.resolve_policy``).

The bridge lives in the wrapper — not the kernel/SDK — because the dependency
direction is one-way: the wrapper *may* import the SDK (``lingtai_sdk.bash_tools``)
and the wrapper capability; the **kernel/SDK must never import the wrapper**.
Putting the SDK import here (lazily, inside the bridge functions) preserves that
one-way ``wrapper -> sdk`` edge.

The SDK ``BundleHost`` invokes its handler with keyword args; the wrapper ``bash``
handler takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny ``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the
two without changing either contract — the identical adapter the file / lifecycle /
communication / mcp / knowledge bridges use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the ``bash``
tool — ``bash.setup()`` remains the live path. It is an additive, observable seam:
a host (or a test) can drive the real ``bash`` tool through the declared manifest.
The declared danger posture (bundle-level ``destructive`` plus the per-action risk
table) is **not** enforced here: this bridge only hosts and runs the real handler,
and danger-based gating is the stage-17 guard bridge's job, not installed here.
Constructing the bridge host runs no command and starts no job — only an explicit
``host.invoke("bash", action="run", command=...)`` does, gated exactly as the live
path does (by the resolved ``BashPolicy`` and the working-directory sandbox).
Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
