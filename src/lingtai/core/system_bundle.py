"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``system`` lifecycle tool through the SDK
bundle declaration (stage 3C).

The high-state counterpart of ``lingtai.core.file_bundle`` (which bridges the
low-state file tools). Where ``file_bundle`` injects the wrapper's real
``read``/``glob``/``grep`` and ``write``/``edit`` handlers into the non-native
file-tool bundles, this module injects the **real ``system`` handler** into the
privileged, native-only ``system`` lifecycle bundle and so proves the
high-state bundle-execution pattern end to end against actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the file tools (wrapper capabilities with a ``make_handler(agent)`` factory
in ``lingtai.core.{read,write,...}``), ``system`` is a **built-in tool**:
``lingtai.core.system.handle(agent, args)``. The kernel wires it live
in ``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics`` as ``self._intrinsics["system"] =
lambda args: system.handle(self, args)`` — that closure is the live registration
path, and it is **left untouched** by this stage.

The bridge therefore reuses that *same* ``handle`` function — there is no second
implementation. The bundle-hosted ``system`` tool runs byte-identical logic to the
intrinsic the kernel dispatches, against the same ``agent`` state (``agent._admin``
karma/nirvana authority, ``agent._working_dir``, ``agent._cpr_agent``, the
notification surface, …) and the same per-action authority gates
(``core.system.karma._check_karma_gate``). The bridge lives in the wrapper —
not the kernel — because the dependency direction is one-way: the wrapper *may*
import the SDK (``lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools``) and the built-in tool; the
**kernel must never import the SDK**. Putting the SDK import here preserves that.

Import direction is the same wrapper→sdk edge ``file_bundle`` uses; the SDK is
imported lazily inside the bridge function, not at module load, so importing this
module does not eagerly pull the SDK.

The wrapper bundle host (``NativeBundleHost``) invokes its handler with keyword
args; the built-in tool ``handle`` takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny
``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the two without changing either contract — the
identical adapter ``file_bundle`` uses.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the
``system`` tool — ``_wire_intrinsics`` remains the live path. It is an additive,
observable seam: a host (or a test) can drive the real ``system`` lifecycle tool
through the declared manifest, which is the high-state migration template later
stages build on. In particular, the declared danger posture on the ``system``
manifest (bundle-level ``destructive`` plus the per-action ``SYSTEM_ACTION_RISK``
grading) is **not** enforced here: this bridge only hosts and runs the real
handler, and the real karma/nirvana authority gate is the built-in tool's, not
this bridge's. Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
