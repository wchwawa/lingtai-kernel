"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``soul`` inner-voice tool through the SDK
bundle declaration (stage 3J).

The inner-voice counterpart of ``lingtai.core.system_bundle`` (the ``system``
lifecycle bridge, stage 3C) and ``lingtai.core.psyche_bundle`` (the ``psyche``
identity/context bridge). Where those inject the real ``system`` / ``psyche``
handlers into their privileged, native-only core bundles, this module injects the
**real ``soul`` handler** into the privileged, native-only ``soul`` inner-voice
bundle and so proves the high-state bundle-execution pattern end to end against
actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly like ``system`` / ``psyche``, ``soul`` is a **kernel intrinsic**:
``lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.soul.handle(agent, args)``. The kernel wires it live
in ``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics`` as ``self._intrinsics["soul"] =
lambda args: soul.handle(self, args)`` — that closure is the live registration
path, and it is **left untouched** by this stage.

The bridge therefore reuses that *same* ``handle`` function — there is no second
implementation. The bundle-hosted ``soul`` tool runs byte-identical logic to the
intrinsic the kernel dispatches, against the same ``agent`` state (the
``_soul_fire_lock`` fire gate, ``_soul_delay`` cadence, the consultation pipeline,
``logs/`` ledgers, and the ``.notification/soul.json`` surface). The bridge lives
in the wrapper — not the kernel — because the dependency direction is one-way: the
wrapper *may* import the SDK (``lingtai_sdk.soul_tools``) and the kernel intrinsic;
the **kernel must never import the SDK**. Putting the SDK import here (lazily,
inside the bridge functions) preserves that.

The wrapper bundle host (``NativeBundleHost``) invokes its handler with keyword
args; the kernel intrinsic ``handle`` takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny
``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the two without changing either contract — the
identical adapter ``system_bundle`` / ``psyche_bundle`` use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the ``soul``
tool — ``_wire_intrinsics`` remains the live path. It is an additive, observable
seam. The declared danger posture on the ``soul`` manifest (bundle-level
``caution`` plus the per-action ``SOUL_ACTION_RISK`` grading) is **not** enforced
here: this bridge only hosts and runs the real handler; danger-based gating is the
stage-17 guard bridge's job, not installed here. Nothing here runs at ``Agent``
construction time, and constructing the bridge host runs no LLM and spawns no
consultation thread — only an explicit ``host.invoke("soul", action=...)`` would,
exactly as the live path does (and the ``flow`` fire stays gated by the kernel
intrinsic's ``agent._soul_fire_lock``).
