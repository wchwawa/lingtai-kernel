"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``psyche`` identity/context tool through the
SDK bundle declaration (stage 3J).

The identity/context counterpart of ``lingtai.core.system_bundle`` (the ``system``
lifecycle bridge, stage 3C). Where ``system_bundle`` injects the real ``system``
handler into the privileged, native-only ``system`` lifecycle bundle, this module
injects the **real ``psyche`` handler** into the privileged, native-only ``psyche``
identity bundle and so proves the high-state bundle-execution pattern end to end
against actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly like ``system``, ``psyche`` is a **built-in tool**:
``lingtai.core.psyche.handle(agent, args)``. The kernel wires it live
in ``BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics`` as ``self._intrinsics["psyche"] =
lambda args: psyche.handle(self, args)`` — that closure is the live registration
path, and it is **left untouched** by this stage.

The bridge therefore reuses that *same* ``handle`` function — there is no second
implementation. The bundle-hosted ``psyche`` tool runs byte-identical logic to the
intrinsic the kernel dispatches, against the same ``agent`` state (``system/``
files, ``history/`` snapshots, the molt machinery, the notification surface). The
bridge lives in the wrapper — not the kernel — because the dependency direction is
one-way: the wrapper *may* import the SDK (``lingtai_sdk.psyche_tools``) and the
built-in tool; the **kernel must never import the SDK**. Putting the SDK import
here (lazily, inside the bridge functions) preserves that.

The wrapper bundle host (``NativeBundleHost``) invokes its handler with keyword
args; the built-in tool ``handle`` takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny
``_kwargs_adapter`` reconciles the two without changing either contract — the
identical adapter ``system_bundle`` uses.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the
``psyche`` tool — ``_wire_intrinsics`` remains the live path. It is an additive,
observable seam. The declared danger posture on the ``psyche`` manifest
(bundle-level ``destructive`` plus the per-(object, action) ``PSYCHE_OBJECT_ACTION_RISK``
grading) is **not** enforced here: this bridge only hosts and runs the real handler;
danger-based gating is the stage-17 guard bridge's job, not installed here. Nothing
here runs at ``Agent`` construction time, and constructing the bridge host writes no
file and sheds no context — only an explicit ``host.invoke("psyche", object=...,
action=...)`` would, exactly as the live path does.
