"""Email intrinsic — filesystem-based mailbox with search and contacts.

Re-exports the full public surface of the former monolithic email.py so all
existing import sites continue to work unchanged.

Sub-modules:
    primitives.py  — Mailbox I/O, ID generation, read tracking, delivery, display.
    schema.py      — Tool registration (get_description, get_schema).
    manager.py     — EmailManager class (the core filesystem manager).

Storage layout:
    working_dir/mailbox/inbox/{uuid}/message.json     — received
    working_dir/mailbox/sent/{uuid}/message.json      — sent
    working_dir/mailbox/archive/{uuid}/message.json   — archived from inbox
    working_dir/mailbox/read.json                     — read tracking
    working_dir/mailbox/contacts.json                 — contact book

Internal:
    boot(agent) — instantiates EmailManager on agent._email_manager.
        Called from base_agent during agent construction.
    handle(agent, args) — module-level dispatcher; delegates to the manager.

Note: recurring/scheduled sends were removed in favor of cron. The email
tool is now request/response only.
