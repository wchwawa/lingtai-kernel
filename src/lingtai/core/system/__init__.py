"""System intrinsic — runtime, lifecycle, and synchronization.

Actions (voluntary, agent-callable):
    refresh   — stop, reload MCP servers and config from working dir, restart
    sleep     — self only, go to sleep (no karma needed)
    lull      — put another agent to sleep (requires karma)
    suspend   — suspend another agent (requires karma)
    cpr       — resuscitate a suspended agent (requires karma)
    interrupt — interrupt a running agent's current turn (requires karma)
    clear     — force a full molt on another agent (requires karma)
    nirvana   — permanently destroy an agent's working directory (requires nirvana)
    presets   — list available presets in the agent's library
    dismiss   — clear one `.notification/<channel>.json` surface (guarded by producer policy)

Action (kernel-synthesized by default — also callable voluntarily by the agent):
    notification — voluntary call returns a placeholder dict; the canonical
                   live notification payload (``notifications`` +
                   ``_notification_guidance``) is then stamped onto that same
                   result by the turn loop's meta-block post-hook. The kernel
                   also synthesizes this call on the agent's behalf when
                   changes arrive during IDLE/ASLEEP states — in that case
                   the synthesized pair carries ``_synthesized: True`` plus
                   the same canonical payload.

Identity, runtime, and stamina state surface via other channels:
    - identity prompt section — every turn, cached prefix
    - meta line `context.{system,history}_tokens` + `stamina_left_seconds`
      on every tool result and text input
    - `.status.json` — written by the kernel; read with read({".status.json"})
      when the agent wants the deep dive

Sub-modules:
    preset.py        — _preset_ref_in(), _check_context_fits(), _refresh(), _presets().
    karma.py         — _KARMA_ACTIONS, _NIRVANA_ACTIONS, _check_karma_gate(),
                       _sleep(), _lull(), _suspend(), _cpr(), _interrupt(),
                       _clear(), _nirvana().
    notification.py  — _dismiss() function.
    schema.py        — get_description(), get_schema().
