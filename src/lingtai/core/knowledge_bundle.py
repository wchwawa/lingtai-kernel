"""Wrapper-side bridge: host the real ``knowledge`` tool through the SDK
catalog bundle declaration (stage 3G).

The catalog counterpart of ``lingtai.core.mcp_bundle`` (the ``mcp`` registry-view
bridge, stage 3F), ``lingtai.core.communication_bundle`` (the ``email`` / ``daemon``
bridge, stage 3D), ``lingtai.core.system_bundle`` (the lifecycle bridge, stage 3C),
and ``lingtai.core.file_bundle`` (the file-tool bridge, stages 3A/3B). The SDK
module :mod:`lingtai_sdk.knowledge_tools` *declares* the ``knowledge`` private-
memory catalog surface as a :class:`~lingtai_sdk.capabilities.BundleManifest` and
offers a host injection seam, but — to respect the import boundary (the SDK must
not import the wrapper, and the kernel must never import the SDK) — it ships **no
real handler**. This module is where the wrapper, which *may* import the SDK and
the wrapper capability, injects the genuine handler and so proves the catalog
bundle-execution pattern end to end against actual behavior.

Where the real handler lives — and why the bridge lives here
------------------------------------------------------------
``knowledge`` is a **wrapper capability** (like ``mcp``, ``daemon``, and the file
tools), not a kernel intrinsic. Its real handler is the closure
``lingtai.core.knowledge.make_handler(agent)`` builds — the *same* closure
``knowledge.setup()`` registers via ``agent.add_tool`` (single source of truth; see
``lingtai.core.knowledge.make_handler``). The bridge reuses that *same* factory —
there is no second implementation. The bundle-hosted ``knowledge`` tool runs
byte-identical logic to the tool ``setup()`` registers, against the same
``agent._working_dir`` and the same ``_reconcile`` (scan ``knowledge/`` →
re-render the ``knowledge`` system-prompt section → health snapshot) semantics.
The bridge lives in the wrapper — not the kernel/SDK — because the dependency
direction is one-way: the wrapper *may* import the SDK
(``lingtai_sdk.knowledge_tools``) and the wrapper capability; the **kernel/SDK must
never import the wrapper**. Putting the SDK import here (lazily, inside the bridge
functions) preserves that one-way ``wrapper -> sdk`` edge.

The SDK ``BundleHost`` invokes its handler with keyword args; the wrapper
``knowledge`` handler takes a single ``args: dict``. The tiny ``_kwargs_adapter``
reconciles the two without changing either contract — the identical adapter the
file / lifecycle / communication / mcp bridges use.

This module does **not** change how ``Agent`` registers or dispatches the
``knowledge`` tool — ``knowledge.setup()`` remains the live path. It is an
additive, observable seam: a host (or a test) can drive the real ``knowledge``
catalog tool through the declared manifest, the catalog migration template later
stages build on. Constructing the bridge host writes nothing — only an explicit
``host.invoke("knowledge", action="info")`` re-reconciles, exactly as the live
path does. Nothing here runs at ``Agent`` construction time.
