"""Notification filesystem — `.notification/` dropbox + sync primitives.

Producers write JSON files; the kernel reads them and syncs the agent's
wire context to match.  This module provides the file-level helpers
(fingerprint, collect, publish, clear).  The sync-loop logic — strip +
reinject into the wire — lives on :class:`BaseAgent`.

Naming convention:

* Kernel intrinsics write ``<intrinsic_name>.json`` (e.g. ``email.json``,
  ``soul.json``, ``system.json``).
* MCP-loaded servers write ``mcp.<server_name>.json`` (e.g.
  ``mcp.imap.json``, ``mcp.telegram.json``).

The basename is the *tool* whose namespace owns the notification.

Notification-file design rationale and staged implementation notes are
preserved in this module, its Git history, and related PR / issue records.

    """Submit a notification with the standard envelope.

    This is the canonical entry point for in-process producers.  It
    wraps :func:`publish` with the envelope shape documented in the
    design (``notification-filesystem-redesign.md`` §2.1.3) and stamps
    ``published_at`` automatically.  Producers supply only what is
    semantically theirs:

    Args:
        workdir: The agent's working directory.
        tool_name: The producer's namespace key — ``email``, ``soul``,
            ``system``, ``mcp.<server>``, …  This becomes both the file
            basename (``<tool_name>.json``) AND the dict key the agent
            sees when it reads ``system(action="notification")``.
        data: Structured payload the agent will read.  No restrictions
            on shape — producers decide.
        header: One-line glanceable summary used by frontends (TUI
            status bar, portal cards) for compact rendering.
        icon: Optional glyph for status indicators.  Defaults to 🔔;
            common conventions: 📧 (mail), 🌊 (soul), 💬 (chat), …
        priority: ``"low"``, ``"normal"``, or ``"high"``.  Frontends
            may surface high-priority notifications more prominently.
        instructions: Optional agent-facing directive describing how to
            dismiss or act on this notification.  Surfaces as a
            top-level field in the wire JSON so the agent reads it
            inline with the rest of the envelope.  Producers that
            require an explicit dismissal action (e.g. email's
            ``read``) put the instructions here so the directive lives
            with the payload rather than in a static prompt.  Omit
            when the notification is purely informational.

    External producers that cannot import the kernel (e.g. MCP servers
    over SSH) should use :func:`publish` directly with the same
    envelope shape.  The contract is the filesystem layout; this
    helper is a Python-side ergonomics layer.

    Example::

        submit(agent._working_dir, "email",
               header=f"{n} unread",
               icon="📧",
               instructions="Call email(action='read', email_id=[...]) to dismiss handled mails.",
               data={"count": n, "previews": [...]})

    To clear a notification (e.g. when state empties) call
    :func:`clear` — there is no separate "submit empty" path.
