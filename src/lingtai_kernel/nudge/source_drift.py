"""Nudge: warn the agent when on-disk source has drifted since startup.

A long-running agent process may have imported old code before a fix landed
in the repository (e.g. ``git pull`` + ``pip install -e .`` on a dev
install).  This nudge re-runs the same dual fingerprint that was captured
at startup (git rev + source digest) and compares with
``agent._runtime_fingerprint``.  When the two disagree, the running
interpreter is stale: only a full process relaunch (``system(action='refresh')``)
picks up the new code.

Throttled to one check per 60 seconds so a long-running agent doesn't get
a flood of nudge entries on every heartbeat tick.  If the on-disk state
returns to match the startup fingerprint (revert, or stale state from a
prior process), the previously-emitted entry is cleared.
