"""Per-agent nudges — periodic checks that emit a notification when
something needs the agent's attention.

Each check is a self-contained module exposing ``check(agent) -> None``.
The check owns its own throttle/dedupe state (stored as attributes on the
agent instance) and decides which notification surface it owns. Most nudges
upsert/remove entries in the shared ``.notification/nudge.json`` payload;
goal reminders read protected ``.notification/goal.json`` and publish short
``goal.reminder`` events into ``.notification/system.json``.

Channel ``.notification/nudge.json`` carries a list of active nudges:

    {
      "header": "<rendered by _render_header — e.g. '2 nudges'>",
      "icon": "🔔",
      "priority": "low",
      "instructions": "Call notification(action='dismiss_channel', channel='nudge') ...",
      "data": {"nudges": [{"kind": "kernel_version", ...}, ...]}
    }

Each check identifies its slot by a unique ``kind`` string. ``upsert``
replaces (or appends) one entry; ``remove`` deletes one. When the last
entry leaves, the channel file is cleared so the agent's wire surface
drops the notification entirely. The agent dismisses everything at once
with ``notification(action='dismiss_channel', channel='nudge')``.

To add a new nudge: drop ``nudge/<name>.py`` exposing ``check(agent)``,
then add an import + dispatch line to :func:`run_checks` below. No
registry, no protocol — keep the surface flat.

Concurrency: the RMW upsert/remove path holds a small per-agent lock
because multiple checks running on the same heartbeat tick would
otherwise lose entries. The lock is created lazily on first use.
