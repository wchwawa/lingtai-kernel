"""Versioned migration runner for kernel-managed on-disk state.

Mirrors `tui/internal/globalmigrate` from the TUI repo. The TUI runs its
analogue once at process start against `~/.lingtai-tui/`; the kernel owns
append-only, forward-only migration registries for the on-disk shapes it
manages.

Two domains currently share this runner:

- **Preset library migrations** run once per preset directory, triggered
  lazily from `lingtai.presets.discover_presets` / `load_preset`. Their
  version counter lives in `<presets_dir>/_kernel_meta.json`.
- **Agent workdir migrations** run once per agent working directory before
  `init.json` validation/refresh. Their version counter lives in
  `<workdir>/system/migrations/_kernel_meta.json`.

Each domain has an append-only registry. Each migration claims a strictly
increasing version number. A migration runs at most once per target directory;
when its version number ≤ the on-disk counter, it is skipped.

Best-practice invariants:
- Versions form a contiguous strictly-increasing sequence (1, 2, 3, ...)
  within each domain. The runner asserts this at import time so a typo in a
  registry fails fast rather than silently mis-ordering migrations.
- Current versions are derived from registries — there are no hand-maintained
  constants that can drift out of sync with the migrations actually registered.
- Forward-only: a meta file with a future version (e.g. from a newer kernel
  that was later downgraded) is honored as-is and never rolled back. A warning
  is logged so the operator knows.
- Tmp-file writes use a PID suffix so concurrent processes (parent + avatar)
  sharing the same target directory do not clobber each other's in-flight write.
