"""System prompt — section manager + builder.

SystemPromptManager manages named sections of an agent's system prompt.
Sections are rendered in a configurable order. The default order groups
sections by mutation frequency so cache breakpoints can be placed between
batches:

    Batch 1 — immovable after init (ideal cache-read prefix):
        principle (no header) → covenant → tools → substrate → procedures → comment
    Batch 2 — rarely mutated (most stable first):
        rules → brief → library → codex → identity → pad

`substrate` sits **right after tools** so it functions as the long-form
companion to the schemas above it: tool schemas carry mechanical
reference (parameter names, types, one-line action descriptions),
substrate carries the operational wisdom (tool tiers, data-flow
topology, life states, channel discipline, attention model — patterns
that span multiple tools). The kernel ships `lingtai/prompts/substrate.md`
as the packaged default (v1); the `Agent` subclass copies it to
`system/substrate.md` on first boot, where the agent (or human) can
edit it freely.

build_system_prompt() assembles base_prompt + rendered sections.
