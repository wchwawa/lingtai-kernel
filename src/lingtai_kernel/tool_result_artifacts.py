"""Tool-result artifact store — preventive spill + retroactive history compaction.

Two related concerns live here:

1. **Preventive spill** (``spill_oversized_result``) — called by ``ToolExecutor``
   on every newly-built tool result.  If serialized content exceeds
   ``PREVENTIVE_MAX_CHARS`` (10_000), the full original is written to
   ``<workdir>/tmp/tool-results/<…>.{json,txt}`` and a compact manifest dict
   (``status="spilled"``, ``artifact="lingtai_tool_result_spill"``) replaces
   the wire-bound content.

2. **Retroactive compaction** (``compact_oversized_history``) — called by the
   AED retry path in ``base_agent/turn.py`` *before* the LLM retry/replay
   happens.  Walks the live ``ChatInterface._entries`` and rewrites any
   ``ToolResultBlock.content`` that already grew past ``RETROACTIVE_MAX_CHARS``
   (5_000) into the same manifest shape.  Entry order, role, ids,
   ``tool_call``/``tool_result`` pairing, and ``synthesized`` flags are
   untouched — only ``ToolResultBlock.content`` is mutated.

Both paths produce the same manifest dict, recognised by
``is_spill_manifest``.  The retroactive helper uses that recogniser to skip
content that is already a manifest, making compaction idempotent across
repeated AED retries.

The 10K cap on the live wire vs. the 5K cap on history is deliberate: a
freshly-built result has room for stamp_meta and small reserved warnings,
while a result already sitting in history is a sunk cost we want to shrink
hard before retry to free up provider tokens.
