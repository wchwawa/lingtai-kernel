"""Shared low-level filesystem / JSON / JSONL helpers for kernel state writes.

This module is dependency-light (stdlib only) on purpose: it sits *below* the
rest of the kernel so any module can import it without creating cycles.  It
centralises the small set of I/O decisions that were previously re-solved,
slightly differently, in dozens of call sites:

- crash-atomic replace via a temp file in the *same directory* + ``os.replace``
  (atomic only on the same filesystem, so the temp must be a sibling of the
  target, never ``/tmp``),
- one UTF-8 / ``ensure_ascii`` policy for model-visible JSON,
- a single ``read_json(default=...)`` exception policy,
- append-only JSONL with a returned byte offset for callers that index records.

The helpers intentionally match the *existing* dominant behaviour so callers
can migrate without changing public file formats:

- ``atomic_write_json`` writes ``json.dumps(obj, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)``
  with **no** trailing newline (matches ``Workdir.write_manifest``).
- ``fsync`` is **opt-in** (default off) so migrating a non-fsync caller does not
  silently change durability behaviour.
- ``append_jsonl`` defaults to ``ensure_ascii=True`` to match the token ledger
  and other ASCII-escaped JSONL logs; pass ``ensure_ascii=False`` for
  UTF-8-preserving logs.

See ``ANATOMY``/issue #510 for the staged migration plan.

    pid-only/fixed temp names as a same-process collision risk: two writers

    the other and the loser fails with ``FileNotFoundError`` or, worse, writes
    into an inode already renamed onto the target).

    umask, preserving the permission semantics of the plain-``open`` atomic
    writes these helpers replace. ``mkstemp`` forces mode ``0o600``, which
    ``os.replace`` would then carry onto the target, silently tightening the
