    entry of the fresh session, return a "faint memory" result.

    The agent's summary lives in ``args.summary`` of its own ToolCallBlock.
    After the wipe we replay that ToolCallBlock into the fresh interface,
    so on the next turn the agent reads its own briefing exactly as it
    reads any past tool_use it has made. The dict returned by this function
    becomes the matching ToolResultBlock's content (paired by the standard
    return path: ToolExecutor.make_tool_result → session.send → adapter
    appends user-role tool_result to the fresh interface). The result is
    deliberately spare — counts and archive pointer, the faint shape of
    "you just woke up; the dream is gone but the briefing you wrote stands."

    ``_tc_id`` is injected by ``base_agent._dispatch_tool`` and carries the
    wire tool_use_id of the molt call. We use it to locate the original
    ToolCallBlock in the pre-molt interface so the replayed assistant entry
    keeps the agent's verbatim args (summary, keep_tool_calls, reasoning).

    Optional ``keep_tool_calls`` is a list of LingTai-issued tool-call ids
    (the ``_tool_call_id`` field stamped into every tool-result content by
    LLMService.make_tool_result). Each named pair survives the wipe and is
    replayed BEFORE the molt's own assistant entry, so chronologically the
    fresh interface reads: kept pairs (older) → molt call (just made) →
    faint-memory result (returned by this fn). Validation runs BEFORE any
    mutation: if any id is unknown the molt is refused and the molt count
