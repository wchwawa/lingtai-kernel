"""Notification intrinsic — the standalone notification surface.

This intrinsic owns the notification-facing verbs: reading the live
notification surface and clearing notification mirrors.  It is the **only**
agent-callable home for those operations — the ``system`` tool no longer
exposes any notification verb (no ``notification``/``dismiss`` compatibility
alias).  ``system`` retains ``summarize`` (and the lifecycle/karma actions);
``summarize`` is *not* a notification verb and stays under ``system``.

Dismissal is **atomic**: there is no single kitchen-sink ``dismiss``.  Each
removal target has its own action so the API expresses exactly what is being
cleared:

Actions:
    check          — voluntary read of the live notification surface.  Returns
                     a placeholder dict; the turn loop's meta-block post-hook
                     stamps the canonical ``_meta.notifications`` +
                     ``_meta.notification_guidance`` payload onto this same result.
    dismiss_channel — clear one ``.notification/<channel>.json`` surface whole.
                     Rejects ``event_id``/``ref_id`` (those are atomic-event
                     verbs).  Producer-owned state is never touched; guarded
                     mirrors refuse without ``force``.
    dismiss_event  — remove a single ``system`` event by ``event_id`` from
                     ``.notification/system.json``.
    dismiss_ref    — remove ``system`` event(s) by ``ref_id`` from
                     ``.notification/system.json``.

All three dismiss verbs delegate to the single canonical
:func:`lingtai_kernel.notifications.dismiss_channel` with
``invoked_by="notification"``.  The decision logic (allowlist, ``post-molt``
ack-reason, protected channels, generic-dismiss guard, and stale-channel-version
refusal) lives there, so every guard holds through this tool by construction.
``large_tool_result`` reminders may be dismissed as an escape hatch (e.g. for
stale or pre-molt refs that can no longer be summarized); doing so acknowledges
the ref_id so the rescan does not immediately recreate the same notification.
Summarization via ``system(action="summarize")`` remains the preferred discharge
and auto-clears the matching reminder.
