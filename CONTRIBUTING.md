## Workflow

Use a branch and worktree for non-trivial changes, keep changes focused, and open
pull requests rather than pushing directly to `main`.

```bash
git fetch origin main
git worktree add -b <branch-slug> .worktrees/<slug> origin/main
cd .worktrees/<slug>
```

Before requesting review, run the narrow tests relevant to your change and at
least `git diff --check`. For code changes, prefer targeted `pytest` runs plus
any package/build checks affected by the diff.

## Root hygiene

The repository root is reserved for entry points, legal files, build metadata,
and tool files that must live at root. Long-form references, language variants,
plans, and archival material belong under `docs/`.
