# LingTai SDK — Architecture Foundation

> Status: **foundation PR**. This document describes the first, deliberately
> modest step of the kernel → SDK split. It establishes a public doorway and
> seed contracts; it does **not** migrate the runtime, the core bundles, or the
> distribution. The "Staged roadmap" section lists what is intentionally left
> for later.

## 1. Where we are today

The repository ships two packages inside one `lingtai` PyPI wheel:

- **`lingtai_kernel`** (`src/lingtai_kernel/`) — the minimal agent runtime.
  Dependency-light, usable standalone. Owns `BaseAgent`, intrinsics, the LLM
  protocol ABCs + service, mail/logging services, and core utilities.
- **`lingtai`** (`src/lingtai/`) — the batteries-included wrapper. Depends on
  the kernel one-directionally. Owns `Agent`, the 19 capabilities, LLM adapter
  implementations, FileIO/Vision/Search services, MCP, the CLI, and addons.

The dependency rule is strict and one-way: **the kernel never imports the
wrapper.**

## 2. What this PR adds: a third public name

This PR introduces a third top-level package, **`lingtai_sdk`** (`src/lingtai_sdk/`),
as the curated *public front door*. It is a consumer of the other two packages,
never a dependency of them:

```
lingtai_sdk  ──imports──▶  lingtai          (lazy)
            ──imports──▶  lingtai_kernel   (eager)

lingtai      ──imports──▶  lingtai_kernel
lingtai_kernel              (imports neither)
```

The SDK package is shipped inside the existing `lingtai` wheel for now; a
distribution/package rename is a later step (see roadmap).

### SDK / CLI split

- **SDK** = the curated *importable* surface (`import lingtai_sdk`) plus the
  contract DTOs. It is what an embedder builds against in-process.
- **CLI** stays exactly where it is: `lingtai.cli` (`lingtai-agent run …`). This
  PR does not touch the CLI; existing entrypoints and runtime behavior are
  unchanged.

## 3. Import purity: eager kernel, lazy wrapper

`import lingtai_sdk` must stay as dependency-light as `import lingtai_kernel` —
safe in tooling, type stubs, and environments where the wrapper's provider SDKs
(anthropic, openai, google-genai, mcp, …) are not installed.

- **Eager** (loaded at `import lingtai_sdk`): `BaseAgent` and the kernel-backed
  `types` / `errors` names. The kernel pulls no heavy provider SDK.
- **Lazy** (loaded on first attribute access): `Agent` and the service classes,
  resolved via :pep:`562` `__getattr__` and cached thereafter. Touching
  `lingtai_sdk.Agent` imports `lingtai`; if the wrapper is absent you get a
  clear `ModuleNotFoundError` naming `lingtai`, not an import-time crash.

This is enforced by a subprocess test (`tests/test_sdk_import_purity.py`) that
asserts a bare `import lingtai_sdk` loads neither the wrapper nor any heavy
provider submodule.

> Implementation note: importing the kernel does load the *bare* `google`
> namespace package — an ambient site-packages artifact pulled in transitively
> by `filelock` (`google.__file__ is None`). It is a harmless stub, not a
> provider SDK, so the purity check targets heavy submodules (`google.genai`,
> `google.generativeai`) rather than bare `google`.

## 4. Compatibility: re-export, never fork

The SDK exposes existing names under a stable public path **by re-export**, so
the SDK name and the legacy name are the *same object*. There is no parallel
hierarchy and no re-implementation.

`lingtai_sdk._compat.DEPRECATIONS` is the machine-readable map of legacy →
recommended-SDK import paths. No name is removed within a major version; a name
graduates from "active alias" to "removed" only across a major bump (its
`removed_in` is filled). A round-trip test (`tests/test_sdk_compat.py`) asserts
every active alias resolves to the same object on both sides.

### Migration table (current)

| Legacy path | SDK path | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| `lingtai_kernel.BaseAgent` | `lingtai_sdk.BaseAgent` | `BaseAgent` |
| `lingtai.Agent` | `lingtai_sdk.Agent` | `Agent` |
| `lingtai_kernel.config.AgentConfig` | `lingtai_sdk.types.AgentConfig` | `AgentConfig` |
| `lingtai_kernel.state.AgentState` | `lingtai_sdk.types.AgentState` | `AgentState` |
| `lingtai_kernel.message.Message` | `lingtai_sdk.types.Message` | `Message` |
| `lingtai_kernel.types.UnknownToolError` | `lingtai_sdk.errors.UnknownToolError` | `UnknownToolError` |

The legacy paths keep working — this table records the *recommended* move, not a
breaking change.

## 5. Runtime contract seed

`lingtai_sdk.runtime` defines the provider-agnostic shapes for driving a future
live runtime: options in, messages in, a stream of events out. They are pure
dataclasses/ABCs with **no kernel import**, so importing the contract is
provider-free.

- `RuntimeOptions` — backend-neutral inputs (working dir, provider/model,
  capabilities, manifest, adapter-scoped `extra`).
- `RuntimeMessage` — an inbound message handed to a session.
- `RuntimeEvent` + `EventKind` — an outbound event (state/text/tool/usage/…),
  with `state()`/`text()`/`error()` convenience constructors.
- `RuntimeState` — coarse session lifecycle (pending/active/idle/asleep/stuck/stopped).
- `RuntimeSession` / `Runtime` — the ABCs a backend implements. `Runtime.run()`
  is a small convenience that creates and starts a session.

There is **no live runtime in this (stage 0) PR.** A thin `NativeRuntime`
(wrapping the existing `Agent` unchanged) lands in **stage 1** (see §8 and §10);
any non-native backend lands later, once the shapes have stabilized against the
capability/prompt contracts.

## 6. CapabilityBundle manifest seed

`lingtai_sdk.capabilities` defines the *public schema* for what a capability
bundle **declares** — decoupled from how it is **implemented**. Native,
privileged handlers stay in the kernel/wrapper; only the declaration lives in
the SDK. This lets the kernel, the wrapper, and external embedders agree on the
shape of a bundle without coupling to its internals.

- `BundleManifest` — `name`, `version`, `summary`, `roles`, `surfaces`,
  `security`, `transport`, `manual`, `metadata`; with `validate()` and
  `to_dict()`.
- `RoleFlags` — `required`, `privileged`, `native_only`, `can_override`,
  `backend_replaceability` (`native_only` / `replaceable` / `augmentable`).
  Invariant: a `native_only` bundle must also be `privileged` and declare
  `backend_replaceability=NATIVE_ONLY`.
- `CapabilitySurfaces` — the named surfaces a bundle contributes: `tools`,
  `resources`, `prompts`, `events`, `hooks`, `lifecycle`, `state`.
- `SecurityPolicy` — `permissions`, `requires_confirmation`, `danger`
  (validated against `SecurityDanger`: `safe` / `caution` / `destructive` — see
  §15.1).
- `TransportSpec` — `kind` (validated against `TransportKind`: `native` /
  `in_process` / `stdio` / `http` — see §15.1) + config.

The only concrete bundle is `proof_bundle()` — a synthetic, metadata-only,
read-only `echo` bundle that exercises the schema end to end at the lowest
possible risk. **Core bundles (`system` / `psyche` / `soul`) are deliberately
not migrated in this PR.**

### 6.1 The load/host boundary (proof)

The schema alone is a declaration; proving it is *usable* means walking the
whole path a non-native host walks for a declared bundle:

```
declared manifest (plain dict)
   -> capabilities.load_manifest()   # parse + validate -> typed BundleManifest
   -> capability_host.BundleHost      # register manifest + tool handlers
   -> BundleHost.invoke(tool, ...)    # call a declared, harmless tool
```

- `capabilities.load_manifest(data)` is the inverse of `BundleManifest.to_dict()`:
  it reconstructs the nested frozen dataclasses and the `BackendReplaceability`
  enum from a plain dict, then `validate()`s — so a loaded manifest is always a
  valid one. Unknown enum values, non-mapping nested blocks, or failed
  invariants raise `BundleLoadError`. Unknown keys are ignored (forward
  compatibility).
- `capability_host.BundleHost` is the **non-native** host. It validates the
  manifest on registration, **refuses** any `privileged`/`native_only` bundle
  (only the native runtime may host those — which is exactly why the core
  bundles stay out), and enforces the manifest↔implementation contract: every
  declared `surfaces.tools` name has a handler and no handler is undeclared.
  Breaches raise `BundleHostError`.
- `capability_host.proof_host()` wires `proof_bundle()` to a deterministic,
  network-free `echo` handler. `proof_host().invoke("echo", text="hi")` returns
  `{"echo": "hi"}` with no I/O — the end-to-end proof.

Both modules are import-pure (no wrapper, no provider SDK), so `import
lingtai_sdk.capability_host` stays as cheap as the schema. This proves the
*boundary*; it does **not** migrate any real intrinsic behavior, wire the
wrapper's real capabilities through manifests, or touch the kernel turn loop.


## 7. Top-level assets and `lingtai-sdk-skill`

The CapabilityBundle model does **not** require abandoning top-level SDK assets.
Instead, the long-term direction is that a top-level **`lingtai-sdk-skill`** can
act as a superset and observation entrypoint for those assets:

- it can contain the system-prompt templates and reusable prompt fragments that
  used to look like standalone top-level assets;
- it can use the familiar skill layout (`SKILL.md`, `reference/`, `scripts/`,
  `templates/`, examples) so other coding agents can inspect LingTai's operating
  model without importing the runtime;
- the CLI/backend assembly layer decides which templates from that skill are
  loaded for a specific runtime/profile;
- CapabilityBundles may point at skill/manual assets, but they do not force every
  asset to live inside each bundle.

So the relationship is:

```text
lingtai-sdk-skill/        # top-level skill-shaped asset superset and observer entry
  SKILL.md
  reference/
  templates/             # system prompt templates, covenant/procedures/substrate fragments
  scripts/

CapabilityBundle.manual  # per-capability manual/asset pointer into skill-shaped layouts
```

This preserves the usefulness of top-level assets while still giving the SDK a
single, skill-shaped semantic container for manuals, templates, and coding-agent
observation.

**Realized in stage 6 (§14):** the `lingtai-sdk-skill` asset is now committed at
`src/lingtai_sdk/assets/lingtai-sdk-skill/SKILL.md` and adopted as a real,
non-privileged CapabilityBundle (`lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill`). The asset and the
bundle exist; the broader CLI/backend assembly layer that *selects* templates per
profile is still future work.

## 8. Staged roadmap

This PR is **stage 0: the foundation.** Each later stage is its own reviewable
PR, sequenced so contracts stabilize before implementations depend on them.

1. **Stage 0 (this PR) — foundation.** Public doorway, import-purity guarantee,
   compatibility map, runtime + capability-bundle contract seeds, docs.
2. **Stage 1 — live NativeRuntime _(skeleton + LLM-service translation landed;
   see §10, §11)_.** A thin `Runtime`/`RuntimeSession` implementation wrapping
   the existing `Agent` (no kernel turn-loop changes), driven through the
   contract from stage 0. Tested against a fake agent — no real model, API key,
   or running process. Stacked on the stage-0 PR. The default-factory
   LLM-service translation (§11), `manifest.llm` translation (§12), and a
   **minimal live event bridge** (§13) landed as stacked follow-ups within
   this stage.
3. **Stage 2 — capability-bundle adoption** _(first real adoption landed; see
   §14)_. Express *low-risk* real capabilities as `BundleManifest`s. The
   committed `lingtai-sdk-skill` asset is now adopted as a real, non-privileged
   bundle hosted across tool/resource/prompt surfaces (§14); wiring the
   wrapper's own existing capabilities through manifests remains follow-up work.
   Still no `system`/`psyche`/`soul`.
4. **Stage 3 — core bundle migration.** Migrate the privileged core bundles,
   once the manifest schema and the native runtime have proven out.
5. **Stage 4 — non-native backend (e.g. Anthropic).** Only after the runtime,
   capability, and prompt contracts are stable. Maps `RuntimeOptions` onto the
   provider client and bridges its message stream onto `RuntimeEvent`.
6. **Stage 5 — distribution rename.** Split or rename the published package so
   `lingtai_sdk` is the headline import; today it rides inside the `lingtai`
   wheel.

### Intentionally deferred (NOT in the stage-0 PR)

- Any live runtime (`NativeRuntime` and friends). _(The stage-1 skeleton lands in
  the stacked PR described in §10.)_
- An Anthropic (or other non-native) backend.
- Migration of core `system` / `psyche` / `soul` bundles.
- Distribution / package rename.
- Changes to the CLI or to existing `lingtai` / `lingtai_kernel` runtime
  behavior.

## 10. Stage 1 — the NativeRuntime skeleton (stacked PR)

Stage 1 is a small PR **stacked on top of stage 0**. It adds the first live
runtime adapter — `lingtai_sdk.native.NativeRuntime` — proving the stage-0
contract can wrap the existing wrapper `Agent` without making the import
boundary worse. It deliberately stops at a *skeleton*: no kernel turn-loop
changes, no `LLMService` construction, no non-native backend.

### What it adds

- **`NativeRuntime(Runtime)`** (`id = "native"`) — a factory whose
  `create_session(options)` returns a `NativeRuntimeSession`. An injectable
  `agent_factory` lets tests substitute a fake agent.
- **`NativeRuntimeSession(RuntimeSession)`** — wraps an `Agent`:
  - `start()` builds the agent (lazily, via the factory), calls `Agent.start()`,
    and transitions `PENDING → ACTIVE`, emitting a `STATE` event. Idempotent.
  - `send(message)` normalizes `str`/`RuntimeMessage` and routes onto
    `Agent.send()` — the existing fire-and-forget inbox path, so it never blocks
    on a turn. Before `start()` it emits a non-fatal `ERROR` event and no-ops.
  - `events()` yields a non-blocking, re-iterable snapshot of queued
    lifecycle / notification / error events.
  - `stop()` calls `Agent.stop()` and transitions `→ STOPPED`. Idempotent.
- **`_agent_kwargs_from_options(options)`** — a pure translation helper
  returning `(agent_kwargs, deferred)`.

### Translation: applied vs. deferred

| `RuntimeOptions` field | Stage-1 handling |
|---|---|
| `working_dir` | → `Agent(working_dir=...)` (required) |
| `agent_name`, `capabilities`, `addons`, `streaming` | → `Agent(...)` kwargs when set |
| `provider`, `model`, `base_url`, `api_key` | stage 1: **deferred** → `session.deferred['llm']`. **Stage 2 (§11):** on the default factory path these build the `LLMService` and move to `session.applied['llm']` (secret-free) |
| `manifest`, `system_prompt_overrides`, `extra` | **deferred** → `session.deferred[...]` (recorded, not applied) |

Deferring rather than force-applying keeps stage 1 honest: anything recognized
but not yet wired is visible on the session, never silently dropped.

### Import purity

`native.py` imports only the pure `runtime` contract at module load. The
wrapper `Agent` is imported **lazily**, inside `start()` / the default factory.
`NativeRuntime` / `NativeRuntimeSession` are exported from the package root via
a separate `_LAZY_SDK_EXPORTS` map that resolves from the import-pure `.native`
module — so accessing the names and *constructing* a `NativeRuntime` stays free
of the wrapper's provider SDKs; they load only when a session actually starts.
A subprocess test asserts this.

### Tested without a model

All stage-1 tests run with no API key and no real agent process: a fake agent
is injected through `agent_factory`, so lifecycle transitions, event emission,
`send()` routing, and the translation table are all exercised in-memory.

## 11. Stage 2 — LLM-service translation (stacked PR)

Stage 2 is a small PR **stacked on top of the stage-1 skeleton**. It closes
GLM stage-1 review nit **N2**: the default `agent_factory` called
`Agent(**kwargs)` without a `service`, but the wrapper `Agent` (via `BaseAgent`)
requires one — so a real `start()` raised an opaque missing-`service`
`TypeError`. Stage 2 makes the default factory build the service the agent
needs, and fails loudly and early when it can't.

### What it adds

- **`_llm_service_from_options(options)`** — lazily imports
  `lingtai.llm.service.LLMService` (which registers the built-in adapters and
  pulls the active provider's SDK) and builds a service from `provider` /
  `model` / `base_url` / `api_key`. The lazy import keeps `import
  lingtai_sdk.native` and constructing a `NativeRuntime` provider-free.
- **`NativeRuntimeConfigurationError`** (`lingtai_sdk.errors`, subclass of
  `LingTaiSDKError`) — raised *before* any agent is constructed when the default
  factory is used but `provider`/`model` are partial or absent. The session
  stays `PENDING`; no opaque `TypeError` leaks. The message never echoes
  `api_key`.
- **`session.applied`** — a secret-free record of what was actually applied to
  the agent. On the default path, the LLM config moves out of
  `session.deferred['llm']` (cleared to `{}`) and into `session.applied['llm']`
  with `api_key` stripped (`_public_llm_fields`).
- **`_uses_default_factory`** — an injected `agent_factory` bypasses service
  building entirely (it supplies its own agent/service), so fakes and hosts boot
  without a real `LLMService` and the runtime stays network-free.

### Applied vs. deferred (stage 2)

| `RuntimeOptions` field | Default factory | Injected factory |
|---|---|---|
| `provider`, `model`, `base_url` | built into `LLMService`, recorded in `session.applied['llm']` | left in `session.deferred['llm']` (factory owns the service) |
| `api_key` | consumed into the `LLMService`; **never** stored on the session, in events, or in errors/reprs | **never** stored on the session; the injected factory owns any service/secret handling |
| `manifest`, `system_prompt_overrides`, `extra` | still deferred (init.json-level translation is a later stage) | still deferred |

### Secret hygiene

`api_key` is consumed into the `LLMService` constructor and **never** retained on
the session, surfaced in any `RuntimeEvent`, echoed in
`NativeRuntimeConfigurationError`, or written to `session.applied`. The applied
record is built by `_public_llm_fields`, which drops `api_key` by construction.

### Out of scope (deferred past stage 2)

- init.json-level manifest translation — stage 2 plumbs only
  `provider`/`model`/`base_url`/`api_key`; `api_compat`, `default_headers`,
  `compact_threshold`, `max_rpm`, `context_window`, etc.
  (`build_provider_defaults_from_manifest_llm`) land in **stage 3 (§12)**.
- A non-native backend, a live event bridge, and any kernel turn-loop change.

### Tested without a model

Stage-2 tests run with no API key and no network: the service builder is
monkeypatched with a fake, the default factory is exercised through a fake agent
that mirrors the real `service`-required contract, and a subprocess test asserts
that constructing a `NativeRuntime` and a session with LLM options stays
provider-free (`tests/test_sdk_native_runtime_llm.py`).

## 12. Stage 3 — manifest.llm translation (stacked PR)

Stage 3 is a small PR **stacked on top of stage 2**. It picks up the
init.json-level manifest translation that stage 2 left out of scope: the default
factory can now derive its `LLMService` config (and recognized provider defaults
/ context window) from `RuntimeOptions.manifest`, especially `manifest['llm']`,
when the explicit `RuntimeOptions` fields are absent.

### What it adds

- **`_llm_config_from_options(options)`** — a pure helper that merges the LLM
  config. Explicit `RuntimeOptions.provider/model/base_url/api_key` win; the
  `manifest['llm']` block fills only the fields the caller left unset. Never
  imports `lingtai`.
- **`_max_rpm_from_options_or_manifest(options)`** — resolves `max_rpm` in
  precedence order: `extra['native']['max_rpm']` → `extra['max_rpm']` →
  `manifest['max_rpm']` → `manifest['llm']['max_rpm']`. Returns `0` when unset —
  unlike the CLI (which defaults to 60), the SDK does **not** impose RPM gating
  unless a host opts in.
- **`_context_window_from_options_or_manifest(options)`** — resolves an optional
  `context_window`: `manifest['llm']['context_window']` →
  `manifest['context_limit']` → `extra['native']['context_window']` →
  `extra['context_window']`. Returns `None` (service keeps its own default) when
  unset.
- **`_llm_service_from_options` (updated)** — uses the merged config, and when a
  `manifest['llm']` block is present, plumbs recognized provider defaults
  through `build_provider_defaults_from_manifest_llm` **scoped to the merged
  provider** (so an explicit `provider` override does not strand the defaults
  under the manifest's provider key), and passes `context_window` when resolved.
  Both `LLMService` and the defaults builder are lazily imported — module-load
  import purity is unchanged.
- **Sanitized deferred manifest** — `session.deferred['manifest']` is a copy
  with `manifest['llm']['api_key']` redacted, so a manifest-carried secret never
  reaches the public deferred surface. The original `RuntimeOptions.manifest` is
  left untouched.

### Applied vs. deferred (stage 3)

| `RuntimeOptions` source | Default factory |
|---|---|
| explicit `provider`/`model`/`base_url` **or** `manifest['llm'].*` | merged (explicit wins), built into `LLMService`, recorded in `session.applied['llm']` |
| explicit `api_key` **or** `manifest['llm']['api_key']` | consumed into the `LLMService`; **never** stored on the session, in events, or in errors/reprs; redacted from `session.deferred['manifest']` |
| `manifest` provider defaults (`api_compat`, `default_headers`, `compact_threshold`, `max_rpm`) | passed to `LLMService(provider_defaults=...)`, scoped to the merged provider |
| `context_window` / `context_limit` | passed to `LLMService(context_window=...)` when resolved |

If both explicit and manifest LLM config are absent/partial, the merge still
yields no `provider`/`model` and `_llm_service_from_options` raises
`NativeRuntimeConfigurationError` (session stays `PENDING`, message never echoes
`api_key`) — same contract as stage 2, now evaluated *after* the manifest merge.

### Out of scope (still deferred)

- Migrating `system` / `psyche` / `soul` into `BundleManifest` form.
- A non-native (e.g. Anthropic) backend.
- A live event bridge from the agent's activity onto `RuntimeEvent` _(landed in
  the stacked follow-up described in §13)._
- Any kernel turn-loop / BaseAgent / Agent change.

### Tested without a model

Stage-3 tests run with no API key and no network: a fake `LLMService` and a fake
`build_provider_defaults_from_manifest_llm` are monkeypatched onto
`lingtai.llm.service` to capture their arguments, the default factory is
exercised through a `service`-required fake agent, the pure merge/`max_rpm`/
`context_window` helpers are asserted directly, and a subprocess test confirms
constructing a `NativeRuntime` and a session with a `manifest['llm']` block stays
provider-free (`tests/test_sdk_native_runtime_manifest.py`).

## 13. Stage 4 — a minimal live event bridge (stacked PR)

Stage 4 is a small PR **stacked on top of stage 3**. It closes the last item
§10 left open for the `NativeRuntime` line: making the running agent's *existing*
activity observable through the stage-0 `RuntimeEvent` contract, so a host that
drives a session through `events()` sees more than lifecycle/notification/error
records. It does this **without touching the kernel turn loop, BaseAgent, or
Agent** — the bridge is built entirely from surfaces the kernel already exposes.

### What it adds

- **`RuntimeEvent.tool_call` / `.tool_result` / `.usage`** — three new
  convenience constructors on the contract DTO (pure, no kernel import),
  mirroring the existing `state` / `text` / `error` ones, so emission is tidy
  and the event `data` shape is consistent.
- **`_install_event_bridge(agent)`** — called from `start()` right after the
  agent is built (when `bridge_events` is `True`, the default). It wraps the
  agent's overridable hooks as **instance attributes** (shadowing the bound
  methods on that one agent; the class and kernel source are untouched):
  - `_on_tool_result_hook(name, args, result)` → emits a `TOOL_CALL` (name +
    args) and a `TOOL_RESULT` (name + result), then calls the original and
    **returns its value unchanged** — an intercepting host hook still
    short-circuits the turn exactly as before.
  - `_post_request(msg, result)` → `_emit_turn_result` emits a `TEXT` event for
    non-empty `result['text']`, a non-fatal `ERROR` per entry in
    `result['errors']`, and a `USAGE` event sampled from
    `agent.get_token_usage()`.
- **`_sample_agent_state()`** — the agent owns its life-state on its own loop
  thread, so rather than splice a callback into that thread, `events()` samples
  `agent._state` on each read and appends a `STATE` event only when the value
  changed since the last read. `AgentState` is a `str` enum, so its `.value`
  (or `str(...)` for a plain-string fake) is used.
- **Thread-safety** — hooks fire on the agent's loop thread while a consumer
  may be reading `events()` on another, so all event appends and the
  last-sampled-state read/write are guarded by a per-session `threading.Lock`.
- **`bridge_events` flag** — threaded `NativeRuntime` → `NativeRuntimeSession`,
  default `True`. Set `False` to fall back to the stage-1 snapshot (lifecycle /
  notification / error only). Missing hooks/accessors are tolerated via
  `getattr` guards so a slimmer fake or future agent shape degrades gracefully.

### What it deliberately is NOT

This is a **minimal** bridge, not a streaming one. `events()` remains a
non-blocking snapshot: there is no incremental token streaming, no
async/await/generator that blocks until the next event, and no bridging of
intra-turn provider chunks. The mapping is also lossy on purpose — it surfaces
what the existing hooks and `_state` already expose, nothing more. Richer
streaming surfaces remain deferred (and overlap with the non-native-backend
work, doc §8 stage 5).

### Out of scope (still deferred)

- Incremental/streaming token events and a blocking `events()` iterator.
- Bridging intra-turn provider message chunks (vs. the per-turn `_post_request`
  summary used here).
- Migrating `system` / `psyche` / `soul` into `BundleManifest` form.
- A non-native (e.g. Anthropic) backend.
- Any kernel turn-loop / BaseAgent / Agent change.

### Tested without a model

Stage-4 tests run with no API key and no running agent: a fake agent that
*invokes* the wrapped hooks (the way the real turn loop would) stands in for the
wrapper `Agent`, asserting the `TOOL_CALL`/`TOOL_RESULT`/`TEXT`/`USAGE`/`ERROR`/
`STATE` mappings, intercept pass-through, state-change de-duplication, the
`bridge_events=False` opt-out, and graceful degradation when an accessor is
absent. One test borrows the genuine `BaseAgent._on_tool_result_hook` /
`_post_request` implementations to pin the bridge to the real hook contract, and
the new contract constructors are covered in
`tests/test_sdk_runtime_contract.py` (`tests/test_sdk_native_runtime_events.py`).

## 14. Stage 6 — committed SDK skill asset + real bundle adoption (stacked PR)

Stage 6 is a small PR **stacked on the stage-5 host proof**. Where stage 5 proved
the manifest/load/host *boundary* against a synthetic metadata-only echo, stage 6
makes the first **real, low-risk** adoption: it ships a committed asset and
expresses it as a non-privileged CapabilityBundle hosted in process. It still
does **not** migrate the privileged core (`system` / `psyche` / `soul`) or touch
the kernel turn loop.

### What it adds

- **A committed asset.** `src/lingtai_sdk/assets/lingtai-sdk-skill/SKILL.md` — the
  top-level SDK *observation entry* of §7, realized. It is a skill-shaped,
  read-only Markdown file describing the SDK/kernel/wrapper split, import purity,
  the runtime contract, the CapabilityBundle contract, and the privileged-core
  deferral, so a later coding-agent or system prompt can point at one stable
  surface without importing the runtime. It lives under the new
  `lingtai_sdk.assets` resource package (`assets/__init__.py` is a marker only),
  reachable via `importlib.resources` and shipped by the
  `lingtai_sdk = ["assets/**/*"]` `package-data` glob.
- **A real bundle over the asset** (`lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill`):
  - `load_sdk_skill()` reads the asset through `importlib.resources` (source
    checkout *or* installed wheel) — network-free and deterministic;
  - `sdk_skill_bundle()` declares a non-privileged, replaceable, `in_process`
    `BundleManifest` with one read-only tool (`read_sdk_skill`), one resource
    (`sdk_skill`), one prompt (`sdk_skill_orientation`), and `manual` pointing at
    the shipped `SKILL.md`;
  - `sdk_skill_host()` returns a ready `BundleHost` wiring those three surfaces to
    deterministic handlers that read the asset.
- **A conservative `BundleHost` extension.** `BundleHost` now hosts read-only
  **resources** (`read_resource(name)`) and **prompts** (`read_prompt(name,
  **kwargs)`) alongside tools, with the same per-surface contract enforcement
  (every declared name has a callable handler, no handler undeclared) via a small
  `_check_contract` helper. It still **refuses** privileged / native-only
  manifests and non-`in_process` transports — unchanged guardrails.

### The adoption path

```
asset (SKILL.md via importlib.resources)
   -> sdk_skill.load_sdk_skill()      # read the committed text
   -> sdk_skill.sdk_skill_bundle()    # declare a validated BundleManifest
   -> capabilities.load_manifest()    # round-trips (dict <-> manifest)
   -> sdk_skill.sdk_skill_host()      # BundleHost: tool + resource + prompt
   -> read_resource / invoke / read_prompt   # deterministic, network-free
```

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate `system` / `psyche` / `soul`, nor any privileged or
  native-only behavior — `BundleHost` would refuse those, and none are named by
  the bundle's surfaces (asserted by a test).
- It does **not** change the kernel turn loop or the wrapper `Agent`.
- It does **not** wire the wrapper's *own existing* runtime capabilities through
  manifests yet, nor add the CLI/backend assembly layer that *selects* templates
  per profile (§7). Those remain follow-up work.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill` and `lingtai_sdk.assets` import no wrapper and no provider
SDK; a bare `import lingtai_sdk` does not eagerly load either. Reads go through
`importlib.resources`, never a raw filesystem path, so they resolve identically
from an installed wheel.

### Tested without a model

`tests/test_sdk_skill_bundle.py` exercises the whole path with no API key and no
running agent: the asset exists and loads via `importlib.resources`; the manifest
validates and round-trips through `load_manifest`; the host reads the resource,
invokes the read-only tool, and renders the prompt deterministically; the host
enforces the resource/prompt contract and rejects unknown/undeclared names; the
bundle names no privileged-core surface; and `lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill` imports
purely.

## 14. Stage 6 — real low-risk bundle adoption + the `lingtai-sdk-skill` asset (stacked PR)

Stage 5 proved the manifest/load/host *boundary* against a synthetic
metadata-only echo (`proof_bundle()`). Stage 6 takes the smallest *real* step
past that: it ships a **committed asset** and adopts it through the same boundary
as a non-privileged CapabilityBundle. It still migrates **no privileged behavior**
and does not touch the kernel turn loop.

### What it adds

- **A committed, read-only asset.** `src/lingtai_sdk/assets/lingtai-sdk-skill/
  SKILL.md` — the top-level SDK *observation entry* (§7). It is skill-shaped
  (YAML frontmatter + prose) and explains the SDK/kernel/wrapper split, the
  runtime contract, the CapabilityBundle contract, and the privileged-core
  deferral, so a coding agent or system prompt can point at one stable surface
  without importing the runtime. `src/lingtai_sdk/assets/` is a resource package
  (`__init__.py` marker only) so the file is reachable via
  `importlib.resources.files("lingtai_sdk.assets")` from a checkout or a wheel;
  packaging is handled by the `lingtai_sdk = ["assets/**/*"]` `package-data` glob.
- **A real bundle over the asset.** `lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill`:
  - `load_sdk_skill()` reads the committed `SKILL.md` through
    `importlib.resources` (deterministic, network-free).
  - `sdk_skill_bundle()` declares a non-privileged, replaceable, `in_process`
    `BundleManifest` with three read-only surfaces — a `read_sdk_skill` tool, an
    `sdk_skill` resource, and an `sdk_skill_orientation` prompt — plus a `manual`
    pointer at the shipped asset.
  - `sdk_skill_host()` returns a ready `BundleHost` wiring those surfaces to
    deterministic handlers reading the asset.
- **A conservative `BundleHost` extension.** `BundleHost` now hosts three
  *read-only* surfaces, not just tools: `invoke(tool, ...)`,
  `read_resource(name)`, and `read_prompt(name, ...)`. Each surface enforces the
  same declared↔provided parity (`_check_contract`): every declared name has a
  callable handler and no handler is undeclared. The privileged/native-only and
  non-`in_process` refusals are unchanged — the guardrail that keeps the core
  bundles out still holds.

The end-to-end adoption path:

```
asset (SKILL.md, importlib.resources)
   -> sdk_skill.load_sdk_skill()      # read the committed asset text
   -> sdk_skill.sdk_skill_bundle()    # declare a validated non-privileged manifest
   -> capabilities.load_manifest()    # round-trips the declaration
   -> sdk_skill.sdk_skill_host()       # BundleHost: tool + resource + prompt
   -> invoke / read_resource / read_prompt   # deterministic, network-free
```

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate `system` / `psyche` / `soul`, nor wire any *privileged*
  wrapper capability through a manifest. `BundleHost` still refuses
  privileged/native-only bundles.
- It does **not** change the kernel turn loop, `BaseAgent`, or `Agent`.
- It does **not** add the CLI/backend assembly layer that selects templates per
  profile (§7) — only the asset and the bundle exist.
- The hosted surfaces are read-only: no mutation, no I/O beyond reading the
  committed asset.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.sdk_skill` and `lingtai_sdk.assets` import nothing from the
`lingtai` wrapper and no provider SDK. `sdk_skill` imports only
`importlib.resources` and the import-pure `.capabilities` / `.capability_host`
siblings; `assets` is a marker package. Enforced by
`tests/test_sdk_skill_bundle.py::test_sdk_skill_import_is_pure`.

### Tested without a model

Stage-6 tests need no API key and no running agent. They assert: the asset
exists and loads through `importlib.resources`; the manifest validates and
round-trips through `load_manifest`; the host exposes and invokes the read-only
tool/resource/prompt deterministically; the per-surface contract (missing /
undeclared / non-callable handler) is enforced; the privileged-core refusal
still holds with the new surfaces present; the bundle names none of
`system`/`psyche`/`soul`; and importing the module stays wrapper-free
(`tests/test_sdk_skill_bundle.py`).

## 15. Stage 7 — strict manifest validation + native privileged bundle contract (stacked PR)

Stage 7 is the **safety-contract layer** immediately before the privileged-core
declaration. Stages 5–6 proved the manifest/load/host *boundary* against
harmless non-privileged bundles; stage 7 *hardens* that boundary on two fronts so
the next stage can declare `system` / `psyche` / `soul` manifests against a
contract that cannot quietly mean something other than it says. It still migrates
**no privileged behavior** and does not touch the kernel turn loop — `system` /
`psyche` / `soul` remain deferred (named only in docs).

### 15.1 Strict manifest validation

`load_manifest()` and `BundleManifest.validate()` no longer accept loose input:

- **Real-boolean role flags.** `required` / `privileged` / `native_only` /
  `can_override` must be *actual* booleans. A previous `bool(...)` coercion let
  the string `"false"` (truthy!) silently *enable* a privilege, or `1` stand in
  for `True`. `load_manifest()` now rejects any non-`bool` present value with
  `BundleLoadError` (an absent flag still falls back to its default). The check
  tests `bool` before `int` because `True`/`False` are `int` instances.
- **Enum-like `danger` and `transport.kind`.** Two public, `str`-valued Enums are
  added to `lingtai_sdk.capabilities`:
  - `SecurityDanger` — `safe` / `caution` / `destructive`;
  - `TransportKind` — `native` / `in_process` / `stdio` / `http`.
  Being `str`-valued, a member compares equal to its wire string and serializes
  transparently through `to_dict()` / JSON, so the `SecurityPolicy.danger` and
  `TransportSpec.kind` fields stay plain strings (no breaking type change). Both
  `validate()` and `load_manifest()` now **reject** any value outside the
  allow-list — `validate()` so a *directly constructed* manifest is also checked,
  `load_manifest()` transitively via the validate step.
- **Strict mappings.** `metadata` and `transport.config` must be mappings. A
  list, tuple, or scalar is rejected with a clear `BundleLoadError` instead of
  being half-coerced (e.g. `dict([...])` quietly accepting a list of pairs). An
  absent block still yields `{}`.

### 15.2 Native privileged bundle contract

A second host joins `BundleHost` in `lingtai_sdk.capability_host`, sharing one
boundary contract via a private `_BaseBundleHost` (manifest validation, the
per-surface declared↔provided handler contract, the three read-only surfaces).
The two hosts differ only in *admission*:

- **`BundleHost` (unchanged).** Still **refuses** any `privileged` / `native_only`
  bundle and hosts only `in_process` transports — the guardrail that keeps the
  privileged core out is byte-for-byte the same behavior (asserted by tests).
- **`NativeBundleHost` (new).** May host a privileged / native-only bundle, but
  only when **explicitly constructed as native authority** — `native_authority`
  is a keyword-only flag defaulting to `False`, so privileged hosting is never
  granted by accident — and only for a `native` transport. It applies the *same*
  manifest validation and the *same* declared↔provided handler contract; a
  privileged bundle with a missing / undeclared / non-callable handler is still
  refused.

`native_privileged_proof_bundle()` + `native_proof_host()` are the
privileged-side mirror of `proof_bundle()` / `proof_host()`: a harmless,
synthetic, native-proof bundle (privileged, `native_only`, `native` transport,
one deterministic `native_noop` tool) that proves the native-authority hosting
boundary end to end. **It names no real privileged surface** — `system` /
`psyche` / `soul` are not migrated here.

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** declare or migrate `system` / `psyche` / `soul` (that is the
  next stage) nor any real privileged surface; `NativeBundleHost` is exercised
  only by the synthetic `native_privileged_proof`.
- It does **not** change the kernel turn loop, `BaseAgent`, or `Agent`.
- It does **not** change `SecurityPolicy.danger` / `TransportSpec.kind` from
  `str` to an Enum-typed field — the public Enums are an *allow-list*, and the
  fields stay string-valued for backward-compatible (de)serialization.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.capabilities` and `lingtai_sdk.capability_host` remain import-pure:
the new Enums, helpers, host, and native proof all import nothing from the
`lingtai` wrapper or any provider SDK. Asserted by the existing module-purity
tests plus `tests/test_sdk_native_bundle_host.py::test_native_bundle_host_import_is_pure`.

### Tested without a model

Stage-7 tests need no API key and no running agent
(`tests/test_sdk_strict_manifest.py`, `tests/test_sdk_native_bundle_host.py`).
They assert: non-`bool` role flags are rejected while real booleans (and absent
defaults) are accepted; the two Enums expose exactly the documented values;
known `danger` / `transport.kind` load and unknown ones raise (through both
`load_manifest()` and `validate()`); non-mapping `metadata` / `transport.config`
are rejected; the proof bundle still round-trips through the stricter loader;
`NativeBundleHost` hosts the privileged native proof *only* with explicit
authority and a `native` transport, enforces the full per-surface contract, and
refuses without authority or with the wrong transport; the `BundleHost`
privileged / native-transport refusals are unchanged; and the privileged host
stays wrapper-free.

### Roadmap note

This closes the **strict-contract** prerequisite for the deferred core-bundle
migration (doc §8 stage 3 / “core bundle migration”): the next stage may declare
`system` / `psyche` / `soul` manifests knowing that (a) a declaration's role
flags, danger, transport, and nested blocks cannot be silently mis-read, and
(b) a privileged manifest can be hosted only by an explicitly-constructed native
authority over a `native` transport. The migration itself — and any real
privileged surface — remains future, higher-risk work.

## 16. Stage 8 — core bundle manifests + a native adapter shim (stacked PR)

Stage 8 is the **first deliberate contact** with the privileged core surfaces
`system` / `psyche` / `soul` — but **only** as a manifest contract plus a
stub-injection seam. It declares the three core bundles as `BundleManifest`s and
adds a thin native adapter that hosts them from an *injected* handler. It
migrates **no implementation**: it never imports, moves, rewrites, or calls the
real `system` / `psyche` / `soul`, and it does not touch the kernel turn loop.
This is the payoff of stage 7's strict-contract layer — the manifests are now
declared against a contract that cannot be silently mis-read, and they can be
hosted only by an explicitly-constructed native authority.

### 16.1 The three core manifests

A new import-pure module `lingtai_sdk.core_bundles` adds `system_bundle()`,
`psyche_bundle()`, and `soul_bundle()`, each returning a `BundleManifest` with
the identical privileged posture:

- `required=True` — boots with every agent;
- `privileged=True` + `native_only=True` — touches kernel-protected surfaces and
  only the native runtime may host it;
- `backend_replaceability=NATIVE_ONLY` — no non-native backend may re-implement it;
- `transport.kind == native` — carried by the native runtime in-process;
- `surfaces.tools == (name,)` — exactly the one public tool, named after the
  bundle (`system` / `psyche` / `soul`), and no other surface.

They differ only in declared `SecurityDanger` (the strict stage-7 allow-list),
mirroring the real surfaces:

- **`system` → `destructive`** — runtime inspection, lifecycle control,
  synchronization, and inter-agent management; some actions irreversibly tear
  down agent state. Highest risk.
- **`psyche` → `destructive`** — identity, pad, and context management
  (edit/load identity and pad, molt, naming); the surface includes the set-once
  `name.set` true-name write, so bundle-level posture matches the strongest
  irreversible sub-action.
- **`soul` → `caution`** — the agent's inner voice (past-self consultation,
  self-inquiry, flow/voice tuning); lower-risk than lifecycle or context
  shedding, but `config` / `voice` persist preferences and therefore are not
  read-only.

Each manifest carries **helpful, non-secret** metadata only (`core`, a one-line
`role` statement, and an `actions` list) — description, never an implementation.
`core_bundle_manifests()` returns the three in stable order (`system`, `psyche`,
`soul`); `core_bundle_names()` and `is_core_manifest()` are the matching
helpers.

### 16.2 The native adapter shim

The shim turns a core manifest plus an *injected* callable into a hosted bundle,
without ever calling the real core:

- `native_core_host(manifest, handler)` builds a `capability_host.NativeBundleHost`
  constructed with `native_authority=True`, hosting the bundle's single declared
  tool with the supplied `handler`. It refuses a non-core manifest or a
  non-callable handler with `BundleHostError`, then defers the manifest/handler
  parity and the native-authority/`native`-transport rules to `NativeBundleHost`
  itself (it never relaxes that contract).
- `native_core_hosts(handlers)` builds `{name: NativeBundleHost}` for all three
  core bundles from a `{name: callable}` mapping. A missing handler, or a handler
  for a name that is not a core bundle, raises `BundleHostError` — so a partial
  wiring can never boot a subset of the privileged core silently.

The handler callables are whatever the native runtime *injects in a later stage*.
This shim provides only the contract enforcement around a supplied callable.

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the existing `system` /
  `psyche` / `soul` implementations. The handlers are injected; this stage ships
  manifests + the injection seam only.
- It does **not** change the kernel turn loop, `BaseAgent`, or `Agent`.
- It does **not** export the core manifests or the adapter from the
  `lingtai_sdk` package doorway — like the stage-5/7 host helpers, they live on
  the `core_bundles` submodule, keeping the public surface minimal until a real
  runtime wires them.
- The non-native `BundleHost` still **refuses** every core bundle (they are all
  privileged / native-only); only a native authority may host them.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.core_bundles` is import-pure: it imports only the import-pure
`.capabilities` / `.capability_host` / `.errors` siblings, so importing it (and
declaring the core manifests) pulls in **no** `lingtai` wrapper module — i.e. the
real `system` / `psyche` / `soul` is not migrated. Asserted by
`tests/test_sdk_core_bundles.py::test_core_bundles_import_is_pure_and_migrates_nothing`.

### Tested without a model

Stage-8 tests need no API key and no running agent
(`tests/test_sdk_core_bundles.py`), and use **dummy lambda handlers only** — no
real core call. They assert: all three manifests carry the shared
`required`/`privileged`/`native_only`/`NATIVE_ONLY`/`native` posture and declare
exactly their one public tool; each validates strictly and round-trips through
`load_manifest()`; the danger postures are `destructive`/`destructive`/`caution` and all
allow-listed; the ordering is stable; the non-native `BundleHost` refuses every
core bundle; `native_core_host()` hosts a core bundle with an injected dummy
(and refuses a non-core manifest or non-callable handler); `native_core_hosts()`
builds all three and refuses a missing / undeclared / non-callable handler; every
produced host is a `NativeBundleHost` (never an in-process `BundleHost`); and
importing `core_bundles` migrates nothing (no `lingtai` module loaded).

### Roadmap note

This is the contract-and-seam half of the deferred core-bundle migration: the
manifests now *exist* and can be hosted via an explicit native authority, but the
privileged *behavior* is still deferred. A later, higher-risk stage supplies the
real injected handlers from the native runtime and wires the hosted core bundles
into a live turn loop.


## 17. Stage 9 — NativeRuntime core bundle seam (stacked PR)

Stage 9 connects the Stage-8 core bundle declarations to the native runtime
**as a visible contract seam only**. It does not migrate the privileged behavior.

`NativeRuntimeSession` now exposes:

- `core_bundle_manifests` — the stable `(system, psyche, soul)` manifests from
  `lingtai_sdk.core_bundles`; every session can inspect the required /
  privileged / native-only capability contract without booting a model or
  importing the wrapper.
- `core_bundle_hosts` — an empty mapping by default. If the host constructs
  `NativeRuntime(core_handlers={...})`, session creation validates the supplied
  injected handlers with `native_core_hosts()` and exposes the resulting
  `NativeBundleHost`s.

The validation remains strict: all three core handlers must be present, no extra
non-core handler is accepted, and every handler must be callable. The hosts are
created through the Stage-8 native-authority path, so the non-native `BundleHost`
still refuses the privileged core. The exposed mapping is a shallow copy, so
callers can inspect or invoke the injected handlers without mutating session
wiring.

What Stage 9 deliberately is **not**:

- no import, movement, rewrite, or call of the real `system` / `psyche` / `soul`
  implementations;
- no kernel turn-loop, wrapper, provider, or non-native backend change;
- no root `lingtai_sdk.__all__` expansion for these submodule helpers.

The import-purity boundary still holds: `import lingtai_sdk.native`, constructing
`NativeRuntime(core_handlers=dummies)`, and creating a session load only
import-pure SDK siblings and do not import the `lingtai` wrapper. Tests exercise
the seam with dummy callables only.


## 18. Stage 10 — thin public client facade (stacked PR)

Stage 10 adds the first small user-facing SDK facade on top of the already
defined runtime contract. It is deliberately a wrapper around the contract, not
a new backend and not a revival of the held PR #321 implementation.

New public pieces:

- `LingTaiClient(runtime=None, options=None)` — a convenience object that owns a
  `Runtime` and optional default `RuntimeOptions`. If no runtime is supplied, it
  imports `NativeRuntime` lazily; the wrapper `Agent` still loads only when a
  native session starts.
- `LingTaiClient.query(message, ...)` — creates a fresh runtime session, starts
  it, sends one `RuntimeMessage`, drains the immediately available events, stops
  by default, and returns a `QueryResult`.
- `QueryResult(text, events)` — stores concatenated `TEXT` event chunks and the
  full event tuple for callers that need state/tool/usage/error data.
- module-level `query(...)` — a one-shot helper around `LingTaiClient`.

The facade is intentionally synchronous and minimal. It does not block on a
full LingTai turn beyond whatever the supplied runtime/session implements; it
only follows the current runtime contract. Tests inject a fake runtime, so the
slice needs no model, no provider key, and no wrapper process.

Import-purity rule: `lingtai_sdk.client` imports only `lingtai_sdk.runtime` and
standard-library modules. The root package exposes `LingTaiClient`,
`QueryResult`, and `query` through the existing SDK-internal lazy export table,
so `import lingtai_sdk` and then accessing the facade stays wrapper-free.

What Stage 10 deliberately is **not**:

- no Anthropic / Claude Code / non-native backend;
- no kernel turn-loop, wrapper, provider, or core bundle behavior change;
- no wholesale import of the held #321 candidate.


## 19. Stage 11 — session facade over RuntimeSession (stacked PR)

Stage 11 fills the gap called out by the Stage-10 GLM review: `query()` is an
immediate-events one-shot helper and should not pretend to hold a conversation
or wait for a full asynchronous native turn. The new session facade gives
callers an explicit live-session surface instead.

New pieces:

- `LingTaiClient.open_session(options=None)` — creates, starts, and returns a
  `LingTaiSession`. Options may come from the client default or the call.
- `LingTaiSession` — a small public wrapper over `RuntimeSession` with
  `send(...)`, `events()`, `text()`, `close()`, `state`, `working_dir`,
  `raw_session`, and context-manager support.
- module-level `open_session(...)` — a one-shot helper mirroring `query(...)` but
  returning a live session.

`LingTaiSession.text()` is a convenience drain for text-only callers: it polls
the currently available events and concatenates only `TEXT` chunks. Any non-text
events drained during that call are discarded from the returned string, so
callers that need state/tool/usage/error/raw data should call `events()` and
inspect the full `RuntimeEvent` tuple instead. The context manager closes the
session on exit and discards the final events; callers that need those final
events should call `close()` explicitly.

This is still only a facade over the runtime contract. It adds no backend, no
blocking turn loop, and no wrapper/provider behavior. Tests use the existing
fake runtime; they verify multiple sends, event polling, explicit/context close,
missing-options errors, and root lazy exports without importing the `lingtai`
wrapper.


## 20. Stage 12 — session facade polish (stacked PR)

Stage 12 is a narrow follow-up to the Stage-11 GLM review nits. It does not add
new runtime behavior. It clarifies the public contract around the existing
session facade:

- `LingTaiSession.working_dir` now carries the same `Path` return annotation as
  the underlying `RuntimeSession.working_dir` contract.
- `LingTaiSession.text()` documents that it drains currently available events but
  returns only concatenated `TEXT` chunks; callers that need state/tool/usage/
  error/raw events should call `events()` directly.
- The Stage-11 documentation explicitly notes that context-manager exit closes
  the session and discards final events; callers needing final events should call
  `close()` explicitly.
- The client facade formatting is cleaned up and tests assert that `text()`
  drains the fake session event queue.

What Stage 12 deliberately is **not**:

- no Anthropic / Claude Code / non-native backend;
- no kernel turn-loop, wrapper, provider, or core bundle behavior change;
- no change to the runtime contract shape beyond the public return annotation on
  the facade property.


## 21. Stage 13 — root runtime contract exports (stacked PR)

Stage 13 is a small public-API ergonomics layer on top of the Stage-10/11 client
facades. The root package now exposes the runtime contract names through the same
SDK-internal lazy export table used by `LingTaiClient` and `NativeRuntime`:

- `RuntimeOptions`
- `RuntimeMessage`
- `RuntimeEvent`
- `RuntimeState`
- `EventKind`
- `Runtime`
- `RuntimeSession`

This lets users write `lingtai_sdk.RuntimeOptions(...)` next to
`lingtai_sdk.query(...)` / `lingtai_sdk.open_session(...)` without a separate
`from lingtai_sdk import runtime` hop. The target module is the existing
import-pure `lingtai_sdk.runtime` contract seed, so the wrapper boundary remains
unchanged: `import lingtai_sdk` and accessing these names do not import the
`lingtai` wrapper or provider SDKs.

What Stage 13 deliberately is **not**:

- no new runtime/backend behavior;
- no kernel turn-loop, wrapper, provider, or core bundle behavior change;
- no change to the runtime DTO/ABC definitions themselves; this only exposes
  existing contract names at the public root.

## 22. Stage 14 — NativeRuntime lifecycle & boot-failure hardening (stacked PR)

Stage 14 hardens the failure paths of `NativeRuntimeSession` so a botched boot,
a failed enqueue, or an unclean shutdown surface as a clear SDK error / event
instead of leaking a half-built session or an opaque underlying exception. It
adds no new runtime behavior on the happy path.

A new error type joins the SDK error surface (`lingtai_sdk.errors`, re-exported
from the root next to its siblings):

- `NativeRuntimeStartError(LingTaiSDKError)` — raised when `start()` fails to
  boot the agent. It is **distinct** from `NativeRuntimeConfigurationError`,
  which stays the *pre-build* error for partial/absent LLM config (raised before
  any agent is constructed, leaving the session untouched).

Three lifecycle methods are hardened:

- **`start()` rollback.** If the agent factory raises, agent construction
  raises, or `agent.start()` raises, the session rolls back to a safe state —
  `_agent` cleared, any LLM-apply reversed back to `deferred`, state normalized
  to `PENDING` — emits a **fatal** `ERROR` `RuntimeEvent`, then raises
  `NativeRuntimeStartError` chaining the original via `__cause__`. The rolled-back
  session is restartable (a later successful `start()` works). The raised error's
  message is generic; it never echoes `api_key`/secrets even when the chained
  cause does. The pre-build `NativeRuntimeConfigurationError` path is unchanged.
- **`send()` guard.** If the underlying `agent.send(...)` raises, `send()` emits
  a **non-fatal** `ERROR` event and returns instead of propagating — a failed
  enqueue does not crash the caller's loop, and the session stays `ACTIVE`. The
  pre-existing not-active behavior (a non-fatal error when the session is not
  active) is unchanged.
- **Dirty-stop signal.** After `agent.stop(timeout)`, if the agent's loop thread
  (`getattr(agent, "_thread", None)`, guarded by a callable `is_alive()`) is
  still alive, `stop()` emits a **non-fatal** `ERROR` event flagging the unclean
  join. State still becomes `STOPPED` — the session is unusable either way.

What Stage 14 deliberately is **not**:

- no kernel turn-loop, wrapper `Agent`, provider, or core bundle behavior change;
- no change to the happy-path lifecycle or to event payload shapes beyond the
  added error events;
- no new retry/backoff policy — rollback only makes a manual retry *possible*.

## 23. Stage 3A — low-state file/query tool bundle template (stacked PR)

Stage 3A is the first **low-risk, real low-state tool** adoption of the
capability-bundle pattern, and the deliberate *template* the remaining low-state
tool migrations follow. Where stage 8 (§16) declared the privileged core
(`system` / `psyche` / `soul`) as manifests hosted only by a native authority,
stage 3A does the non-privileged, in-process equivalent for the three low-state
file/query tools the wrapper already ships: `read`, `glob`, `grep`.

### The boundary reality (why declare-and-inject, not migrate)

The real `read` / `glob` / `grep` live in the wrapper (`lingtai.core.{read,glob,
grep}`) and bind to **wrapper-owned services** at `setup()` time —
`agent._file_io` (the FileIO service, with its path-sandbox and traversal-budget
semantics) and `agent._working_dir`. Two hard rules forbid lifting that behavior
into the SDK:

- **the SDK must stay import-pure** — eagerly importing a wrapper service would
  pull the provider SDKs into `import lingtai_sdk`; and
- **the kernel must never import the SDK** — so no kernel-side shim can reach
  back into `lingtai_sdk`.

So stage 3A follows the same shape every prior stage used: the SDK ships a
**declaration + an injection seam**, and the *wrapper* (which may import the SDK)
injects the real handlers.

### What it adds

- **`lingtai_sdk.file_tools`** (import-pure) — the SDK-side template. It declares
  `read_bundle()` / `glob_bundle()` / `grep_bundle()` as non-privileged,
  freely `REPLACEABLE`, `in_process`, read-only (`SecurityDanger.SAFE`)
  `BundleManifest`s, each declaring exactly its one public tool and carrying a
  language-neutral copy of the tool's argument schema in metadata. The host seam
  `file_tool_host(manifest, handler)` / `file_tool_hosts(handlers)` wires an
  *injected* handler per tool through the non-native
  `capability_host.BundleHost` (the non-privileged mirror of stage 8's
  `native_core_host` / `native_core_hosts`), enforcing the same
  manifest↔handler parity. It imports no wrapper and calls no real file tool.
- **A single source of truth for handler behavior.** `lingtai.core.{read,glob,
  grep}` now each expose a `make_handler(agent)` factory; their `setup()` wires
  *that same* closure via `agent.add_tool(...)`. The tool schema and the
  registered behavior are byte-for-byte unchanged — `setup()` remains the live
  registration path.
- **`lingtai.core.file_bundle`** (wrapper-side bridge) — injects the real
  `make_handler(agent)` closures into `file_tool_hosts(...)` and returns
  `{name: BundleHost}`. `host.invoke("read", file_path=...)` then runs the real
  file-tool logic through the declared manifest, proving the bundle-execution
  pattern against actual behavior. A tiny kwargs adapter reconciles the wrapper
  handler's `args: dict` contract with `BundleHost.invoke`'s keyword args. The
  import direction stays one-way (`wrapper → sdk`).

### The adoption path

```
declared manifest (read/glob/grep, lingtai_sdk.file_tools)
   -> lingtai.core.file_bundle.file_tool_bundle_hosts(agent)   # wrapper injects real make_handler(agent)
   -> file_tool_hosts({name: handler})                          # SDK host seam (BundleHost)
   -> host.invoke(name, **args)                                 # runs the wrapper's existing logic, unchanged
```

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the real `read` /
  `glob` / `grep` *from the SDK*; the implementations stay in the wrapper, bound
  to `agent._file_io` / `agent._working_dir`, with their path-sandbox /
  traversal-budget / error-structure semantics intact.
- It does **not** change the agent's live tool registration or dispatch —
  `setup()` is untouched as the live path; the bundle host is an additive,
  observable seam.
- It does **not** touch high-state tools (`system` / `email` / `daemon` / `mcp`),
  the kernel turn loop, the wrapper `Agent`, providers, or distribution/package
  naming.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.file_tools` imports only the import-pure `.capabilities` /
`.capability_host` / `.errors` siblings; a bare `import lingtai_sdk.file_tools`
pulls in no `lingtai` wrapper module (asserted by
`tests/test_sdk_file_tools.py::test_file_tools_import_is_pure_and_migrates_nothing`).
The wrapper bridge imports the SDK, never the reverse.

### Tested without a model

`tests/test_sdk_file_tools.py` exercises the SDK declarations + host seam with
dummy handlers and the purity subprocess (no API key, no agent). The
*end-to-end* proof against the real behavior is
`tests/test_file_bundle_bridge.py`: it builds an `Agent` with a mock LLM
service, writes real files, and asserts that invoking each tool through the
bundle host returns exactly what the agent's registered handler returns
(parity), and that error structures (missing file, missing pattern) and the
relative-path / working-dir resolution are preserved through the bundle path.

### Roadmap note

This is the low-state half of the capability-bundle migration that complements
the deferred privileged-core work (§16): the non-privileged file/query tools are
now declared and hosted through the same boundary, with the wrapper bridge
proving the execution pattern against real behavior. The remaining low-state
tools (`write` / `edit`, adopted in §24 stage 3B, and other read-only/query
surfaces) follow this exact template; the high-state tools (`system` / `email` /
`daemon` / `mcp`) and any live wiring into the turn loop remain later,
higher-risk PRs.

## 24. Stage 3B — side-effecting file-mutation tool bundle (stacked PR)

Stage 3B is stacked on stage 3A (§23) and extends the file-tool bundle template
from the *read-only / query* tools to the two **side-effecting** low-state file
tools the wrapper already ships: `write` and `edit`. It is the first adoption
where the declared **danger posture matters**, because — unlike read/glob/grep —
these tools mutate the filesystem.

### What it adds

- **`lingtai_sdk.file_mutation_tools`** (import-pure) — the side-effecting
  counterpart of `file_tools`. It declares `write_bundle()` / `edit_bundle()` as
  non-privileged, freely `REPLACEABLE`, `in_process` `BundleManifest`s, each
  declaring exactly its one public tool and carrying a language-neutral copy of
  the tool's argument schema plus a `side_effect: True` metadata marker. The host
  seam `file_mutation_tool_host(manifest, handler)` /
  `file_mutation_tool_hosts(handlers)` wires an injected handler per tool through
  the non-native `capability_host.BundleHost`, exactly as stage 3A does. It
  imports no wrapper and calls no real file tool.
- **A single source of truth for handler behavior.** `lingtai.core.{write,edit}`
  now each expose a `make_handler(agent)` factory; their `setup()` wires *that
  same* closure via `agent.add_tool(...)`. The tool schema and the registered
  behavior are byte-for-byte unchanged — `setup()` remains the live registration
  path.
- **`lingtai.core.file_bundle` (extended)** — the same wrapper-side bridge now
  also injects the real `write` / `edit` `make_handler(agent)` closures via
  `file_mutation_tool_bundle_hosts(agent)`. `host.invoke("write", file_path=...,
  content=...)` then runs the real overwrite, and `host.invoke("edit", ...)` the
  real read-modify-write, through the declared manifest — proving the
  side-effect bundle-execution pattern against actual behavior.

### Why a sibling SDK module, not an extension of `file_tools`

`file_tools` carries an invariant stage 3B must break: *every* manifest it ships
is read-only / `SecurityDanger.SAFE`, built through one shared all-`SAFE`
`_file_tool_manifest` helper. Write/edit are side-effecting and do **not** share
one danger posture, so they cannot flow through that helper without destroying
its guarantee. A sibling module (`file_mutation_tools`) keeps `file_tools` "all
SAFE" and gives the side-effect posture a clean, explicit home.

### The side-effect danger posture (the heart of stage 3B)

The two tools differ in declared `SecurityDanger`, mirroring how the privileged
core (§16) graded `system` vs `psyche`/`soul`:

- **`write` → `DESTRUCTIVE`.** `write` creates a file *or silently overwrites an
  existing one wholesale* — an irreversible clobber of prior content. This is the
  same posture the `system` core bundle uses for its irreversible-teardown
  actions.
- **`edit` → `CAUTION`.** `edit` performs a *bounded, in-place string
  replacement* in an existing file and refuses ambiguous edits (`old_string` not
  found, or found more than once without `replace_all`). It is a real side effect
  with lasting effects, but not a wholesale clobber — the same posture
  `psyche` / `soul` use for lasting-but-not-destructive actions.

This posture is a **declaration only**. Stage 3B installs **no** guard and does
not change live dispatch. The observable consequence is what the existing
stage-17 guard bridge (§ guard-bridge, `lingtai_sdk.guard_bridge`) *would* derive
from these manifests if a later stage chose to install it:

```
write (destructive) -> BLOCKING mode: DENY     | ADVISORY mode: allow + warn
edit  (caution)     -> BLOCKING mode: allow+warn | ADVISORY mode: allow + warn
read/glob/grep (safe) -> clean pass-through (no advisory) in either mode
```

`tests/test_sdk_file_mutation_tools.py` pins exactly this — feeding the write/edit
manifests to `guard_bridge.guard_check_from_manifests(...)` denies `write` in
BLOCKING, warns it in ADVISORY, and always warns `edit` — without this stage
wiring any guard into an `Agent`. The host itself does **not** enforce danger: a
non-native `BundleHost` accepts a `destructive` `write` bundle exactly as it
accepts a `safe` `read` bundle, because gating is the guard bridge's job, not the
host's. This keeps the host a thin executor and the danger posture a pure
declaration.

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the real `write` /
  `edit` *from the SDK*; the implementations stay in the wrapper, bound to
  `agent._file_io` / `agent._working_dir`, with their overwrite / read-modify-write
  / ambiguity-refusal / error-structure semantics intact.
- It does **not** change the agent's live tool registration or dispatch, and it
  does **not** install or wire any guard — `setup()` is the untouched live path;
  the bundle host and the guard-posture declaration are additive, observable
  seams.
- It does **not** touch high-state tools, the kernel turn loop, the wrapper
  `Agent`, providers, or distribution/package naming.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.file_mutation_tools` imports only the import-pure `.capabilities` /
`.capability_host` / `.errors` siblings; a bare `import
lingtai_sdk.file_mutation_tools` pulls in no `lingtai` wrapper module (asserted by
`tests/test_sdk_file_mutation_tools.py::test_file_mutation_tools_import_is_pure_and_migrates_nothing`).
The wrapper bridge imports the SDK, never the reverse.

### Tested without a model

`tests/test_sdk_file_mutation_tools.py` exercises the SDK declarations + host seam
with dummy handlers, the danger-posture / guard-bridge invariant, and the purity
subprocess (no API key, no agent). The *end-to-end* proof against the real
behavior is added to `tests/test_file_bundle_bridge.py`: it builds an `Agent`
with a mock LLM service and asserts that invoking each tool through the bundle
host actually creates/overwrites/edits real files, returns exactly what the
agent's registered handler returns (parity), and preserves the overwrite,
ambiguity-refusal, and error structures through the bundle path.

## 25. Stage 3C — high-state `system` lifecycle tool bundle (stacked PR)

Stage 3C is stacked on stage 3B (§24) and lifts the tool-bundle template from the
*low-state* file tools to the first **high-state** surface: the privileged,
native-only `system` lifecycle tool (refresh / sleep / karma actions / nirvana /
notification / dismiss). It is the high-state mirror of the file-bundle bridge:
declare the bundle (already done in §16 stage 8) + an injection seam, then bridge
the *real* handler through it — without touching live dispatch.

### What makes `system` different from the file tools

Two structural differences drive the design:

- **`system` is a kernel intrinsic, not a wrapper capability.** The file tools
  (`read`/`write`/…) are wrapper capabilities with a `make_handler(agent)` factory
  in `lingtai.core.{...}`. `system` is `lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.system.handle(agent, args)`,
  wired live by `BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics` as
  `self._intrinsics["system"] = lambda args: system.handle(self, args)`. There is
  no wrapper `make_handler` to extract, and nothing in the kernel may be made to
  import the SDK. So the bridge reuses that *same* intrinsic `handle` — the live
  `_wire_intrinsics` path is left **completely untouched** (no kernel extraction),
  and parity is guaranteed by sharing the one function.
- **`system` is privileged / native-only.** Its manifest declares `native`
  transport and `privileged`/`native_only` roles, so it is hosted by the
  native-authority `NativeBundleHost`, not the non-native `BundleHost` the file
  tools use.

### What it adds

- **`lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools`** (import-pure of the wrapper) — the high-state
  declaration module. It does **not** redeclare the `system` manifest:
  `lifecycle_system_manifest()` re-exports the existing
  `core_bundles.system_bundle()` verbatim (one `system` manifest in the SDK). On
  top of it, it adds a **per-action risk table** `SYSTEM_ACTION_RISK`
  (`{action: SecurityDanger}`) with `KARMA_ACTIONS` / `NIRVANA_ACTIONS` /
  `SELF_ACTIONS` partitions and an `action_risk(action)` helper, plus a
  `system`-only native host seam `system_lifecycle_host(handler)` /
  `system_lifecycle_hosts({"system": handler})` wrapping `native_core_host` (so a
  host can adopt `system` without also supplying `psyche`/`soul`).
- **`lingtai.core.system_bundle`** (wrapper-side bridge) — injects the real kernel
  intrinsic `system.handle` (bound to the agent, adapted from `args: dict` to the
  host's kwargs) into the SDK seam via `system_lifecycle_bundle_host(agent)` /
  `system_lifecycle_bundle_hosts(agent)`. `host.invoke("system", action=..., ...)`
  then runs the real lifecycle logic — including the real karma/nirvana authority
  gate — through the declared manifest. The SDK is imported lazily inside the
  bridge functions (wrapper → sdk edge); the kernel intrinsic is imported at
  wrapper module load (wrapper → kernel, allowed).

### The per-action risk grading (the heart of stage 3C)

A single bundle-level `SecurityDanger` cannot faithfully grade `system`: `sleep`
(self only, no authority) and `nirvana` (irreversible teardown of another agent's
working directory) sit at opposite ends. But `system` is *one* public tool with an
`action` discriminator, not one tool per action — so per-action danger cannot vary
at the *manifest* level without forking the live tool registration, which this
stage must not do. The conservative, faithful encoding is therefore:

- **bundle-level posture stays `destructive`** — the strongest action's grade, and
  exactly what the stage-17 guard bridge already derives (`system` denied in
  `BLOCKING`, warned in `ADVISORY`);
- **the graded action table ships as a declaration** (`SYSTEM_ACTION_RISK`):
  self/normal lifecycle (`refresh`/`sleep` → `caution`, `presets`/`notification` →
  `safe`, `dismiss` → `caution`), karma (`lull`/`suspend`/`cpr`/`interrupt`/`clear`
  → `destructive`), nirvana (`nirvana` → `destructive`). An unknown action grades
  conservatively `destructive`.

The grading is a *declaration of* the authority the kernel intrinsic already
enforces in code (`intrinsics.system.karma._KARMA_ACTIONS` / `_NIRVANA_ACTIONS`),
pinned to never drift from it by `tests/test_sdk_lifecycle_tools.py`. It is **never
a second runtime gate**: no guard is installed and the real karma/nirvana gate
stays in the kernel intrinsic.

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the real `system` *from
  the SDK*; the implementation stays in the kernel intrinsic, bound to agent state,
  with its karma/nirvana authority and error structures intact.
- It does **not** change the agent's live intrinsic registration or dispatch
  (`_wire_intrinsics` is the untouched live path), and it does **not** install or
  wire any guard, install a bundle host onto a running agent, or touch the turn
  loop. The bundle host and the danger-posture declaration are additive,
  observable seams.
- It keeps scope to lifecycle/`system` only — `psyche`/`soul` keep their existing
  generic `native_core_hosts` seam, and email/daemon/MCP belong to a later stage.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools` imports only `.capabilities` / `.capability_host` /
`.core_bundles` / `.errors`; a bare `import lingtai_sdk.lifecycle_tools` pulls in
no `lingtai` wrapper module (asserted by
`tests/test_sdk_lifecycle_tools.py::test_lifecycle_tools_import_is_pure_and_migrates_no_wrapper`).
Like `core_bundles`, it transitively loads `lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.*` — *kernel*,
not the forbidden wrapper. The wrapper bridge `lingtai.core.system_bundle` imports
the SDK lazily inside its functions, so a bare import of the bridge leaves
`lingtai_sdk` unloaded (asserted by
`tests/test_system_bundle_bridge.py::test_bridge_does_not_import_sdk_at_wrapper_module_load`).

### Tested without a model

`tests/test_sdk_lifecycle_tools.py` exercises the SDK declaration + per-action risk
table (incl. its parity with the kernel authority sets), the native host seam with
dummy handlers, the guard-bridge invariant, and the purity subprocess (no API key,
no agent). The *end-to-end* proof against the real behavior is in
`tests/test_system_bundle_bridge.py`: it builds a `BaseAgent` with a mock LLM
service and asserts that invoking `system` through the bundle host returns exactly
what the kernel intrinsic returns (parity) for the pure `notification` placeholder,
an unknown-action error, and — crucially — karma/nirvana actions *denied by missing
authority*, proving the real authority gate flows through the bridge unchanged and
*before* any side effect. No test sleeps, refreshes, or destroys an agent.

## 26. Stage 3D — high-state communication/execution tool bundles (stacked PR)

Stage 3D is stacked on stage 3C (§25) and continues the high-state migration to the
two surfaces with **external or process side effects**: `email` (communication —
can send to external SMTP/IMAP recipients) and `daemon` (execution — spawns / kills
child processes and runs long child-agent executions). Same declare-and-inject
pattern as 3C, applied to two surfaces that ride *different* live carriers.

### Two surfaces, two carriers — matching the live wiring

The key insight is that these two high-state surfaces are wired live by **different
mechanisms**, and the bundle declaration must mirror each:

- **`email` is a kernel intrinsic** (`lingtai_kernel.intrinsics.email.handle(agent,
  args)`), wired by `BaseAgent._wire_intrinsics` exactly like `system`. It is
  native-carried and privileged (it touches the agent's mailbox / notification
  state and the configured mail service), but **not** `native_only` — a backend
  could re-implement a mail surface — so its manifest declares `native` transport,
  `privileged=True`, `native_only=False`, `backend_replaceability=AUGMENTABLE`, and
  it is hosted by the native-authority `NativeBundleHost` (like `system`). The
  bridge reuses that *same* intrinsic `handle`; `_wire_intrinsics` is left
  **untouched**, and parity is guaranteed by sharing the one function.
- **`daemon` is a wrapper capability** (`lingtai.core.daemon`), registered live by
  its `setup()` through `agent.add_tool` — the *same non-native, in-process path the
  file tools use*, not an intrinsic. So its manifest declares `in_process`
  transport, `privileged=False`, and it is hosted by the non-native `BundleHost`
  (like `write`/`edit`). To share one behavior between `setup()` and the bridge, a
  behavior-preserving `make_manager(agent, …)` / `make_handler(agent, …)` factory
  was extracted in `lingtai.core.daemon` (the same safe extraction `read`/`write`/…
  already underwent); `setup()` now builds through it and is otherwise unchanged
  (still returns the manager, registers `mgr.handle`, same defaults). Constructing
  the manager neither spawns nor kills any process — only an explicit
  `emanate`/`ask`/`reclaim` does.

### What it adds

- **`lingtai_sdk.communication_tools`** (import-pure of the wrapper) — declares the
  two new manifests (`email_comm_manifest()` native/privileged; `daemon_exec_manifest()`
  in-process/non-privileged), each with a **per-action risk table**
  (`EMAIL_ACTION_RISK`, `DAEMON_ACTION_RISK`) plus `email_action_risk(action)` /
  `daemon_action_risk(action)` helpers and the `EMAIL_SEND_ACTIONS` /
  `DAEMON_PROCESS_ACTIONS` attention subsets, and a host seam per carrier
  (`email_comm_host(handler)` → `NativeBundleHost`; `daemon_exec_host(handler)` →
  `BundleHost`; plus the `communication_tool_hosts({...})` mapping seam).
- **`lingtai.core.communication_bundle`** (wrapper-side bridge) — injects the real
  kernel intrinsic `email.handle` and the real wrapper `daemon.make_handler(agent)`
  (both adapted from `args: dict` to the host's kwargs) into the SDK seams via
  `email_comm_bundle_host(agent)` / `daemon_exec_bundle_host(agent)` /
  `communication_bundle_hosts(agent)`. The SDK is imported lazily inside the bridge
  functions (wrapper → sdk edge); the kernel intrinsic and the wrapper capability
  module are imported at wrapper module load (wrapper → kernel/wrapper, allowed).

### The per-action risk grading

As in 3C, each surface is one public tool with an `action` discriminator, so the
bundle keeps a single **bundle-level danger at its strongest action** and ships a
graded action table as metadata:

- **`email`** — read-only inbox queries (`check`/`read`/`search`/`contacts`) →
  `safe`; self-scoped mailbox/contact mutations (`dismiss`/`archive`/`add_contact`/
  `remove_contact`/`edit_contact`) → `caution`; **outbound sends** that can reach an
  external recipient (`send`/`reply`/`reply_all`) → `caution`; irreversible removal
  (`delete`) → `destructive`. Bundle-level: `destructive` (the strongest action).
- **`daemon`** — read-only status queries (`list`/`check`) → `safe`; process spawn /
  drive / kill (`emanate`/`ask`/`reclaim`) → `destructive`. Bundle-level:
  `destructive`. An unknown action grades conservatively `destructive` on both.

These are *declarations*, never a second runtime gate: no guard is installed; the
live internal/external mail routing stays in the kernel intrinsic and the live
process spawn/kill stays in `DaemonManager`. The stage-17 guard bridge reads the
bundle-level posture (both denied in `BLOCKING`, warned in `ADVISORY`).

### What it deliberately is NOT

- It does **not** migrate, move, rewrite, import, or call the real `email`/`daemon`
  *from the SDK*; implementations stay in the kernel intrinsic and the wrapper
  capability, bound to agent state.
- It does **not** change the live registration/dispatch (`_wire_intrinsics` and
  `daemon.setup()` remain the live paths; the daemon extraction is byte-identical),
  and it does **not** install or wire any guard, mount a bundle host onto a running
  agent, or touch the turn loop.
- It **excludes `mcp`**: the `mcp` capability's live handler is an inline closure
  built inside `lingtai.core.mcp.setup()` with no stable extractable seam, and its
  one `show` action is read-only presentation (registry mutations happen via
  `write`/`edit` on the registry file, not the tool surface) — so it is not a
  high-state communication/execution surface worth bridging, and forcing an
  extraction would change a third live `setup()` for no high-state gain. Declaring
  it is deferred; see the stage-3D implementation report.

### Import purity

`lingtai_sdk.communication_tools` imports only `.capabilities` / `.capability_host`
/ `.errors`; a bare import pulls in no `lingtai` wrapper module (asserted by
`test_sdk_communication_tools.py::test_communication_tools_import_is_pure_and_migrates_no_wrapper`).
The wrapper bridge `lingtai.core.communication_bundle` imports the SDK lazily inside
its functions, so a bare import of the bridge leaves `lingtai_sdk` unloaded
(asserted by
`test_communication_bundle_bridge.py::test_bridge_does_not_import_sdk_at_wrapper_module_load`).

### Tested without external side effects

`tests/test_sdk_communication_tools.py` exercises the declarations, both per-action
risk tables, the correct host carrier per surface (and the wrong host refusing),
the guard-bridge invariant, and the purity subprocess — all with dummy handlers, no
agent. `tests/test_communication_bundle_bridge.py` proves parity against the real
handlers on a `BaseAgent` with a mock LLM service, using only side-effect-free
actions: email `check`/`contacts` (empty mailbox), the reserved `unread` error, and
unknown actions; daemon `list` (fresh run dir) and unknown actions. **No test sends
real mail, sleeps, spawns, drives, or kills any process or subagent.**


## 24. Stage 3K — canonical bundle registry + default live declared-set wiring

After the per-domain tool-bundle declarations landed, the SDK had many local
`<domain>_manifests()` aggregators but no single authoritative view over the
whole declared set. Stage 3K adds that connective tissue:

- `lingtai_sdk.bundle_registry` is import-pure and collects every declared SDK
  `BundleManifest` exactly once in stable order: core → file read/query → file
  mutation → communication/execution → tool-config/catalog → shell → avatar. Core
  is sourced from `core_bundles`, not the lifecycle/psyche/soul re-export modules,
  so `system` / `psyche` / `soul` are never double-counted.
- `BundleRegistry` validates every manifest and indexes by bundle name and by
  tool name. Duplicate bundle names or duplicate tool ownership raise
  `BundleLoadError` immediately rather than silently last-writer-winning.
- `DispatchTarget` records the owning bundle, manifest, and declared danger for a
  tool name. This is a lookup/guard/router seam only; it holds no handler and does
  not call any tool.
- The package root exposes `BundleRegistry`, `DispatchTarget`,
  `all_bundle_manifests`, and `default_registry` lazily through the SDK-internal
  export table, preserving `import lingtai_sdk` wrapper/provider purity.

The wrapper live guard wiring now consumes the canonical registry on its default
path: `lingtai.guard_wiring.wire_agent_guard(agent)` installs an advisory
`ToolCallGuard` from `default_registry().manifests()`. Because the live policy
mode remains `ADVISORY`, this cannot block a tool call: safe declarations pass
through cleanly, caution/destructive declarations warn, and tools absent from the
registry still fail open. Caller-supplied capability registries and the core-only
compatibility helpers remain available, but the default live declared-set source
is now one registry instead of hand-assembled core-only manifests.
