"""The declared-bundle registry and the guard/advisory bridge (read-only).

Two import-pure, network-free surfaces:

* :func:`lingtai_sdk.default_registry` — a validated, name- and tool-indexed
  view over the *full declared* SDK bundle set. It answers "which bundle owns
  this tool, and how dangerous did that bundle declare itself" via
  :meth:`BundleRegistry.dispatch_target`. It declares no handler and calls no
  tool — it is the read-only lookup a router or guard installer consults
  *before* dispatch.

* :mod:`lingtai_sdk.guard` — turns those declared
  :class:`~lingtai_sdk.bundles.contracts.SecurityDanger` postures into a kernel
  ``GuardCheck``. The policy is deliberately narrow and fail-open: ``safe`` →
  clean pass-through, ``caution`` → allow-but-warn advisory, ``destructive`` →
  deny (BLOCKING) or warn (ADVISORY), unknown tool → allow (fail open).

Both are pure metadata operations — nothing is wired into a live agent here.
