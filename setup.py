"""Setuptools shim — adds Rust sidecar build hooks on top of pyproject.toml.

Project metadata lives in ``pyproject.toml``. This file exists only to wire
two extra steps into the standard ``setuptools.build_meta`` flow:

1. **Bundle the Rust sidecar binary into the wheel.**
   ``BuildPyWithSidecar`` and ``BdistWheelImpure`` both call
   ``_ensure_sidecar_built()``, which runs ``cargo build --release`` on
   ``crates/lingtai-search-sidecar`` and copies the resulting binary
   into ``src/lingtai/bin/lingtai-search-sidecar[.exe]``. The function is
   idempotent — repeated invocations are cheap because cargo no-ops when
   nothing changed.

2. **Mark the wheel as platform-specific.** Since the wheel ships a native
   binary, ``bdist_wheel`` is overridden so ``root_is_pure=False`` and the
   wheel filename carries the correct platform tag (e.g.
   ``lingtai-0.10.10-cp311-cp311-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl``). The "is the
   binary actually present?" check runs *after* ``_ensure_sidecar_built()``,
   so soft-fallback builds (no cargo, ``LINGTAI_SKIP_RUST_BUILD=1``) still
   produce a universal wheel and skip the platform tag.

Skip / fallback behavior:

* If ``LINGTAI_SKIP_RUST_BUILD=1`` is set, the cargo step is skipped and
  no binary is bundled. Useful for editable installs / source-only
  contributors who don't have Rust.
* If ``cargo`` is not on ``PATH``, the build emits a warning and proceeds
  without a bundled binary — the wheel will be functional but the Rust
  backend will only activate if the operator supplies a binary out-of-band
  (``LINGTAI_FILE_IO_SIDECAR=…``).
* Set ``LINGTAI_REQUIRE_RUST_BUILD=1`` to make any cargo failure abort the
  build instead of degrading gracefully.
* The Rust crate sources live under ``crates/lingtai-search-sidecar/``
  and are included in sdists via ``MANIFEST.in`` so source builds can
  rebuild from the bundled crate.
