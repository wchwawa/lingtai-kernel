"""Focused unit tests for the ``ToolCallGuard`` failure posture.

The composable guard layer is **fail-open at wiring/collection time but
fail-closed at check-evaluation time**. Wiring-side fail-open is covered by
``tests/test_wrapper_guard_wiring.py`` (a manifest provider that raises while
*assembling* the guard leaves a safe pass-through). The complementary
fail-*closed* contract — a host-supplied check that raises *while judging a
proposal* is coerced to a deny, not skipped — is exercised at the executor
integration level in ``tests/test_tool_executor.py``
(``test_tool_call_guard_check_exception_denies_without_crashing_parallel_batch``).

These tests pin that fail-closed contract directly on ``ToolCallGuard.evaluate``
so a future host wiring custom checks has an explicit, dependency-free statement
of the invariant: a buggy gatekeeper must not become an open gate.
