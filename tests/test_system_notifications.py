"""End-to-end integration tests for system_notification tool-call pairs.

These tests exercise the full path: producer (_enqueue_system_notification)
→ tc_inbox → splice into chat → dismiss (voluntary OR via email.read auto-
dismiss).

Uses ChatInterface + TCInbox directly with a stub-agent harness; the kernel's
LLM/session machinery is NOT exercised here. The integration is at the
bookkeeping level — does the dict get cleaned, does the chat reflect the
right state, does the dual-store dismiss work."""
